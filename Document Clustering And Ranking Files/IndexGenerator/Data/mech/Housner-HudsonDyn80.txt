PREFACE

The present edition incorporates a number of revisions and additions which should improve its usefulness as a textbook without
changing the basic organization or the general philosophy of presentation of the subject matter. The experience of the past few years
at the California Institute of Technology and other schools indicates
that the book has been useful to engineering students who wish to
prepare for more advanced studies and applications of dynamics,
and hence a new edition was felt to be justified.
Among the additions and modifications the following may be
mentioned to indicate the scope of the revision. The section on
dimensional analysis has been rewritten and a brief treatment of the
theory of models has been added. The section on impact problems
has been revised, and a more extensive treatment of variable mass
systems has been included. A more general discussion of the moment of momentum equations for systems of particles has been
added, and the general momentum and energy equations for rigid
bodies have been more completely developed. The discussion of
rotation about a fixed point and gyroscopic motion has been expanded
and somewhat more complex systems have been considered, including
problems on the stability of rolling motion. T h e problem of longitudinal waves in an elastic bar is discussed, and a comparison is made
between wave propagation techniques and vibration methods for
such problems. The discussion of generalized coordinates and Lagrange's equations has been revised, and a general treatment of the
problem of small oscillations of a conservative system has been
added. The sections on the Calculus of Variations and Hamilton's
Principle have been rewritten with some expansion.
Over one hundred new problems have been added to increase the
total number to some four hundred. All of the new problems have

been thoroughly tested in classroom use. The number of illustrative
examples has been increased and many of the original examples have
been modified.
As in the first edition, the main emphasis of the book is on particle
and rigid-body dynamics, although some other aspects of the subject have been included to show how the methods of classical mechanics are applied to the various branches of engineering science.
Some of these topics, such as fluid dynamics and the kinetics of gases,
have been treated in a very brief fashion. Although the student will
make a more complete analysis of these subjects in specialized courses,
it is believed that the brief discussions will help him to acquire a
broader view of the applied sciences. I n all such instances care has
been taken to use methods that can be extended later for more complete treatments, and the student has been informed of the limitations of the analyses.
As a textbook the main emphasis has been on method and on
development of fundamental principles. The problems form an
essential part of the presentation, and important conclusions are
sometimes given in problems and illustrative examples. The student
should examine such problems and note the results, even if the details of the proofs are not carried through.

THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES O F DYNAMICS

. . . the whole burden of philosophy seems to consist in this, from the
phenomena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and from these
forces to demonstrate the other phenomena.-I. Newton, Principia Philosophiae (1686).
The science of mechanics has as its object the study of the motions
of material bodies, and its aim is to describe the facts concerning
these motions in the simplest way. From this description of
observed facts, generalizations can be formulated which permit valid
predictions as to the behavior of other bodies.
The motions occurring in nature are the result of interactions
between the various bodies which make up the system under consideration. That portion of the subject of mechanics which describes
the motion of bodies, without reference to the causes of the motion,
is called kinematics, while that portion which studies the relationship
between the mutual influences and the resulting motions is called
kinetics. These two subjects are usually combined under the name
dynamics, and it is this general problem that is to be treated in this
book.
1.1 The Laws of Motion. The principles of dynamics are
founded upon extensive experimental investigations. The first noteworthy experiments were performed by Galileo (1564-1642). Other
investigators followed Galileo, among them being Newton (16421727), who, after carrying out a large number of experiments,
formulated the statements which are now known as Newton's Laws
of Motion :
1

THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES O F DYNAMICS

(1) Every body persists in a state of rest or of uniform motion
in a straight line, except in so far as it may be compelled by force to change that state.
(2) The time rate of change of momentum is equal to the force
producing it, and the change takes place in the direction
in which the force is acting:

n

F = - ( m v ) ; or, for constant m, F
dl

=

ma

(3) To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction,
or the mutual actions of any two bodies are always
equal and oppositely directed.
These statements may be regarded partly as definitions and partly
as experimental facts. As a description of the behavior of bodies of
ordinary size moving with velocities which are small compared with
the velocity of light, these statements have remained to this day the
most convenient expression of the fundamental principles of
dynamics.
1.2 Definitions. The intuitive concepts which arise concerning
such basic quantities of dynamics as force, mass, and time must be
put into a precise form before they can serve as a foundation for the
development of the subject. The following definitions prescribe the
sense in which these words will be used in this book.*
Force and Mass. The primary objective of the science of
mechanics is the study of the interactions which occur between
material bodies. These interactions are of various types and might
be, for example, impacts, electrical or gravitational attractions,
mechanical linkages, etc. Experience shows that during these interactions, the velocities of the interacting bodies are changed.
We define force, by Newton's first law, as an action which tends to
change the motion of a body. The fact that forces arise from
mutual interactions and thus occur in equal and opposite pairs forms

* A considerable difference of opinion has existed amongst various eminent
authorities as to the most logical form in which to cast the basic definitions
and principles of classical mechanics. Controversy has continued to the
present day, and books and papers appear regularly which aim to give a final
clarification to the matter. For a critical survey of this aspect of the subject,
the classic book of E. Mach, Science of Mechanics (1893), is still of great
interest.

the empirical content of Newton's third law. The concept of force
is made quantitatively precise by the definition that a unit force
produces a unit acceleration of a specified standard body.
The mass of a body may now be defined by Newton's second law
as the ratio of the force acting on the body to the resulting acceleration. By international agreement, the unit of mass is defined as the
mass of a particular platinum-iridium cylinder, called the international prototype kilogram, which is in the possession of the International Committee of Weights and Measures at SBvres, France.
The force exerted upon a body by the earth's gravitational field is
called the weight of the body. The weight of a body is thus variable,
depending upon the location of the body with respect to the earth.
The magnitude of the earth's gravitational field is specified by the
acceleration of gravity (g) which is the acceleration of an otherwise
unrestrained body attracted to the earth. The gravitational acceleration has been determined experimentally and is given at a
latitude and an elevation h ft by the empirical formula:

+

At sea level the maximum variation of g with latitude is of the order
of 0.5%, while the variation from sea level to an altitude of 24,000 ft
is of the order of 0.25%. In engineering it is customary to use a
constant value of g equal to 32.2 ft/sec2.
The mass of any body can be determined by comparing the body
with the standard kilogram. In practice the mass of a body is
usually determined by means of the ordinary balance. The unknown
mass ml is balanced with a known mass m2 so that the weights W1
and Wz are equal. Since ml = Wl/g and m2 = T/Vz/g, it follows that
rnl = mz.
Experiment shows that for the bodies and motions with which the
engineer is usually concerned, the mass of a body is a constant within
the limits of accuracy of measurement. Experiments in atomic
physics, however, show that at sufficiently high velocities the mass
of a particle is not a constant, but, as predicted by the theory of
relativity, is given by

where c is the velocity of light, v the velocity of the particle, and mo

4

THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DYNAMICS

the mass of the particle a t zero velocity.* Because of the large
magnitude of c, it is impossible to detect the variability of mass a t
even the highest velocities encountered in engineering practice. I t
is important to note that Newton's Second Law refers to a specific
body and does not refer directly to a system which is losing or gaining
material.
A number of different standards of mass have been defined in
terms of the prototype kilogram. In the United States the poundmass avoirdupois has been defined legally by Congress as the 1/2.2046
part of the international prototype kilogram. The pound-force is
defined as the gravitational force exerted on a standard pound-mass
when g has the "standard " value of 32.174 ft/sec2. In engineering
the pound-force is taken as the unit of force, but the pound-mass is
not taken as the unit of mass. The engineering unit of mass is that
mass which is given an acceleration of 1 ftlsecz by a force of 1poundforce. This unit of mass is called a slug and is equal to 32.174 poundmass. Since the multiplicity of standards of force and mass sometimes
leads to confusion, a summary of definitions of a number of the
commonly encountered terms is given in Appendix 11.
Time. The unit of time is the second, which is defined as the
1/86,400 part of a mean solar day. The mean solar day is the yearly
average of the time intervals between successive transits of the sun
past a meridian of the earth.
Length. The international standard of length is the standard
meter, which is defined as the distance, at zero degrees centigrade,
between two lines on a platinum-iridium bar in the possession of the
International Committee of Weights and Measures. The United
States Yard is defined legally by act of Congress as the 360013937 part
of the standard meter, and the foot is defined as one-third of a yard.
1.3 Frames of Reference. In the preceding discussion of acceleration, force, and mass, it has been implied that there exists a
frame of reference with respect to which measurements can be made.
In engineering, unless stated to the contrary, it is always understood
that measurements are to be made with respect to a coordinate

* Some physicists prefer to suppose that the mass is constant and that a t
high velocities a suitable transformation of the space-time coordinates must
be introduced. The resulting equations of motion will of course be the same
as those obtained on the above supposition of varying mass. (See refs. 6
and 16.)

system which is fixed at the earth's surface. In astronomy, distances
may be measured with respect to certain stars. In any event it is
always necessary to perform measurements in some coordinate
system which is located with respect to some physical object.
The fact that the coordinate system may be located in various
ways naturally raises the question as to the effect its position might
have on the equations of motion and the solution of problems. It is
possible to select a coordinate system with respect to which it is not
permissible to write simply F = ma. An example is a coordinate
system fixed with respect to an airplane which is making a turn. It
then would be necessary to apply a force to a body in order to keep
its observed acceleration equal to zero. The equation F = ma would
not give a correct description of the motion if the acceleration were
measured with respect to an accelerating coordinate system, for it
would be necessary to add correction terms which take into account
the motion of the coordinate system. It is clearly an advantage to
locate the coordinate system so that such correction terms are not
required. I t was formerly customary to define an absolute space
and to refer all measurements to a coordinate system fixed with
respect to absolute space. I t is now recognized that all measurements are relative, and the concepts of absolute space and time have
been discarded. The location of the coordinate system is now based
upon experience. We locate the system so that the equation F = ma
describes the motion within the required limits of accuracy.
The difficulties associated with the ideas of absolute space, absolute
time, and the location of coordinate systems might seem to be
chiefly problems of philosophy, I t was just these difficulties, however, which led to the formulation of the Theory of Relativity, which
has been of such importance in the development of modem physics.
1.4 Fundamental and Derived Units. A physical quantity can
be measured by a comparison of a sample with a known amount of
the same quantity. The known amount which is taken as a reference is called a unit, and the specification of any physical quantity
requires both an indication of the units used and a numerical value
which gives the number of units contained in the sample.
For the measurement of the physical quantities with which we shall
be concerned in mechanics, it is found convenient to use three independent units. In engineering it is customary to use the unit of

6

T H E G E N E R A L P R I N C I P L E S O F DYNAMICS

length (foot), the unit offorce (pound), and the unit of time (second),
as the threefundamental units. All other quantities can be expressed
in terms of the three fundamental units. The unit of acceleration,
for example, is written (ftlsecz), and the unit of mass, which, from
the equation F = ma is seen to be equal to force divided by acceleration, is written (lb sec2/ft). Such units are called derived units to
indicate the fact that they are expressed by combinations of the
fundamental units. As a matter of convenience the derived units
are sometimes given special names. For example, the foregoing
derived unit of mass is called a slug. Many of the derived units have
no special names, however, velocities being referred to as so many
ft/sec, accelerations as so many ftlsec2, etc.
The system of units described in the preceding paragraph, in which
length-force-time are the fundamental units, is called the (L-F-T) or
gravitational system of units. In physics it is customary to take
length-mass-time as the fundamental units. This system is called
the (L-M-T) or absolute system of units. The words "gravitational"
and "absolute" are merely the names of the systems, and it should
not be inferred that there is anything absolute about a system of units.
The (L-M-T) system differs from the (L-F-T) system only in that
the unit of mass instead of the unit of force is taken as the third
fundamental unit. In the (L-M-T) system the fundamental units
are named the centimeter, the gram, and the second. The derived
unit of acceleration is cm/sec2, and the unit of force is that force
which gives a mass of one gram an acceleration of one cmlsec2.
This derived unit of force, the gram crnlsec2, is called the dyne.
1.5 Dimensions. Quantities which are measured in terms of
derived units are often called secondary quantities, as distinguished
from +rimary quantities, which are measured in fundamental units.
The measured values of such secondary quantities can always be
expressed as products and quotients of certain numbers, as in the
following examples :
n l f t = ---(n1)(12in.) =
velocity = v = n2 sec (nz)(iP,-mm)
n1 lb
- (n1)(I6 02) (ns &jmin)2
mass = m =
n2ft/(nssec)2 (n2)(12in.)

7

DIMENSIONS

in which the constants a, b, c refer to the size of the units, L, F , T,
and the constants n1, nz, ns, refer to the number of such fundamental
units contained in a particular sample of the quantity.*
A consequence of the particular form of the secondary quantities
is the fact that the ratio of two measured values of a secondary
quantity is independent of the sizes of the fundamental units used,
for if:

then :

since the constants a, b, c which define the size of the fundamental
units cancel. This type of independence is of course very convenient for any practical system of units which is to be used to
describe physical situations.
Generalizing from the above examples, we may say that a
secondary quantity q will have the form:

where [FaLW'] is the derived unit, and the exponents a, p, y are
called the dimefisions of q. Some common secondary quantities
and their dimensions are listed in the following tables.

* So-called dimensional constants are sometimes encountered. For example,
the area of a rectangle could be written as A = clw, where A is the area in
acres, 1 the length in feet, w the width in feet, and c = 2.296 x 10-6 acres/ft2.
By a proper selection of units, the dimensional constant can always be given
a value of unity; in the above example, if the unit of area is square feet,
c = 1. It will be noted that secondary quantities, according to the definition
given above, involve systems of units for which c = 1.

The number of fundamental units is to a certain extent arbitrary.
In the field of thermodynamics a fourth fundamental unit is commonly added, which is usually taken as temperature 0. In the field
of electricity, a fourth fundamental unit is also commonly added,
which is often taken as the electric charge Q. The dimensions of

We have shown above that secondary quantities having the form
of products of powers of the primary quantities have the proper
independence of unit size. The converse statement is also true, and
it can be shown in general terms that the secondary quantity must
have this particular form. Consider, for example, two secondary
quantities :

and impose the condition that:

0, etc.

DIMENSIONAL HOMOGENEITY

The solution of these equations will give the form of the function
which will satisfy the condition of independence of size of units and
which will be found to involve products of powers as indicated above.
1.6 Dimensional Homogeneity. Every equation that describes a physical process should be dimensionally correct, that is,
the dimensions on one side of the equation should be the same as the
dimensions on the other side. In the dimensional equations that
follow, we shall indicate the fact that it is the dimensions only which
are equated by enclosing the dimensional expression in square
brackets. For example, the equation for the radial force F,, acting
upon a mass m which moves in a circle of radius r with velocity v is:

Dimensionally,

The equation is thus dimensionally correct. If the dimensions of
such an equation do not check, then we know that an error of some
kind exists.
As a second example, consider the equation describing the velocity
of a particle falling through a resisting medium :

and the dimensions of - are:

Thus the equation is dimensionally correct.
I n the second example it will be noted that the exponent of the
term e-(klm)t is dimensionless. I n any expression of the type
log x, ex, sin x, cosh x, etc., the argument x can always be written as
a dimensionless quantity. This follows from the fact that dimensional homogeneity of an equation involving transcendental functions can be maintained only if the arguments are dimensionless.
This may be seen, for example, by examining the series expansion
for a typical function of this kind:
Having the arguments in a dimensionless form has the advantage
that the terms are independent of the size of the particular fundamental units used.
It is always possible to write a dimensionally homogeneous equation in the form:

...

where nl,nz,
that .rrl can be written as a function of the other dimensionless
quantities. For example, taking the equation used in the second
example above,

we see that this can be put in the form:

where the quantities

($)and (
t )i
are both dimensionless.

1.7 Dimensional Analysis. A study of the dimensions of the
quantities involved in a physical problem may yield some useful
information about the form of the solution. The brief treatment of
this subject which follows is intended to indicate the application of

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

11

the method to mechanics problems, and it should be realized that a
rigorous development of the various theorems and a thorough
examination of the foundations and limitations of the method would
require a much more extended discussion.*
An example has been given of the way in which a dimensionally
homogeneous equation can be expressed in terms of dimensionless
parameters. We shall now indicate the principle behind this
transformation.
If the variables which enter into a particular problem are
(vl, vz . . . v,), the solution of the problem may be written as:
We shall show that under certain conditions this equation can be
written as:
where the 771, TZ,. . . terms are dimensionless, and we shall show
how to determine the number and the composition of these T-terms.
A general requirement which we shall impose on our dimensional
system is that the function f (vl, vz, . . . vn) should remain unchanged
as the sizes of the fundamental units entering into the v's are changed.
In mechanics the equations describing the basic laws are by definition
independent of the size of the fundamental units, and it thus follows
that any equations derived from the basic laws will also have this
same independence. Equations that satisfy this condition are called
$hysical eqzcations.
The variables entering the problem can be written in terms of their
dimensions as :

* The classic book on the subject is P. W. Bridgman, Dimensional Analysis
(1922). I t is interesting to note that this subject has led to many differences
of opinion amongst eminent scientists and engineers. A good summary of
many of these discussions is given in the book by C. M. Focken, Dimensional
Methods, and the other books mentioned in the bibliography may be consulted
for other proofs and examples.

12

THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DYNAMICS

One of the dimensions, as for example all can be eliminated from the
equations by the following change of variables: *
~ 1=
' vl
= [LaiF~iTyi]

--as = [LOFWW]

vZf = 212211

a~

The original equation in terms of these new variables becomes:
Note that the new variables (vz', vat, . . . v;-~) have zero a-dimension,
since the transformation equations have been chosen so that the
a-dimension cancels from all terms except vl. If the function f is to
be independent of a change in size of the fundamental unit L, then
the variable v l which still contains a must have been eliminated by
the above change of variables so that the original equation becomes:
=0
f1(vz', v3#,. . .
In this new function f l the a dimension has disappeared, and the
number of variables has been reduced by one.
By repeating the above process the /3 dimension can be eliminated
through the following change of variables :
v2" = v2'

in terms of which fl becomes:
But f l is to be independent of changes of size of the fundamental unit
F , which appears only in the vz". The equation must then be

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

If this process is repeated to eliminate the third dimension y, the
terms left in the equation will be dimensionless, and the number of
such terms will be (n - 3) so that the equation becomes:
r # ( ~ n2,
l,
nn-3) = 0.
I t will be seen that if in general the number of fundamental units is
N and the number of variables in the problem is n, the above procedure will reduce the number of variables to (n - N) dimensionless terms.*
The nature of the above transformations of the variables also
indicates the general form of the dimensionless n factors. The n
factors are built up out of products of powers of the variables v.
Since these v's must be formed of products of powers of the fundamental units, it follows that the dimensionless n factors must have
the form of products of powers of the fundamental units.
The values of the exponents of the variables appearing in the
dimensionless factors can be found by expressing each variable in
terms of the fundamental units, and by equating to zero the sums
of the exponents for each fundamental unit. N algebraic equations will be obtained from which the ratios of the exponents for
(N + 1) terms can be computed. I t is in this way possible to
determine the exponents for a n term containing not more than
(1V + 1) variables. If a n term is to be unique it is necessary that
it contain a variable that does not appear in any of the other n terms
for otherwise it would be possible to express this term by combinations of other terms. The first n term requires (N 1) variables,
thus leaving n - ( N + 1) variables to form the remaining i s . The
total number of unique n terms that can be formed is therefore
1 -I- n - (N + 1) = (n - N), in agreement with the previous
development.
The foregoing discussion can be summarized in the form of the
so-called n theorem,t which may be stated as follows:

* An exception to this (n - N ) rule occurs, for example, if a statics problem,
in which time does not appear, were to be analyzed using an M-L-T system of
fundamental units in which force has the dimensions [MLT-21. The number
of w terms would be found to be (n - 2), which would indicate that in this
particular problem it would have been more appropriate to use only two
fundamental units L and F.

who first carried through a systematic development of the subject. See

THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DYNAMICS

A physical equation involving n variables expressed by N fundamental
units can be put into the form
where the rr's are dimensionless parameters formed of the products of
powers of the variables. T h e number of such independent .rr terms will
in general be (n - N ).
The application of the above principles is illustrated by the specific
examples to follow. To use the method we must first be in a position
to formulate the basic equations of motion in sufficient detail so that
all of the variables which enter into the problem are known. The
method of dimensional analysis will then give some information
about the form which the solution must take, without the necessity
of actually solving the equations. This information will, however,
never be complete, and dimensional analysis can in no sense be
looked upon as a substitute for the complete analytical formulation
and solution of problems.
EXAMPLE
1. A mass m moves in a circle of radius r with a constant velocity v . What can be concluded as to the force F which
causes the motion ?
Solution. The variables which enter this problem, along with their
dimensions, are :
F = [LOFlTO]
m = [L-lFlT2]
r = [LlFOTO]
v = [LlFoT-I]

There are 4 variables and 3 fundamental units so that there is
4 - 3 = 1 dimensionless term which can be formed. This term is: *
Fntavbrc = [LOF~TO]~[L-~F~T~]~[L~FOT-~]~[L~
- [L-a+b+cFl+aT2a-b]
E. Buckingham, "On Physically Similar Systems; Illustrations of the Use
of Dimensional Equations", Physical Review Vol. 2, (1914), pp. 345.
* Note that we can either use the four exponents a, b, c, d and then solve
the algebraic equations for the ratios of these exponents, or we can assign
a value of unity to one of the exponents, and thus determine numerical values
directly. I n this case the unity exponent should be assigned to the variable
for which the equation is to be solved. If one should happen to give this
unity exponent to a variable which should not have appeared in that particular
* term, the algebraic equations would give the anomalous answer 1 = 0.

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

For the term to be dimensionless it is required that:
l + a = O
2a-b=O
-a+b+c=O

a = -1
b = -2

c = l

The dimensionless term is therefore Frlmv2 and the equation
describing the motion is:

Since m , v, and r are constant, F must also be constant and the
functional form of the equation must be:

where C is a dimensionless constant (pure number). We may
therefore write

If the problem were to be solved completely by using the principles
of dynamics it would be found that C = 1, but we cannot deduce
this from dimensional considerations alone.
EXAMPLE
2. The twist per unit length % of a circular shaft
depends upon the shearing modulus of elasticity G, the diameter d
and the twisting moment Mt. (a) Using dimensional analysis, express
6 as a function of the other variables. (b) If it is found experimentally that 6 varies linearly with Mt, find from the results of the
dimensional analysis of part (a) the way in which % varies with the
diameter d.
Solution. (a) Since time does not appear in this problem there
are only two fundamental units, so that we would expect (4 - 2) =
2 T-factors. TI can be formed by inspection; TI = %d. rrz will
involve (G, dl Mt) so:
[FlL-2]a[FOLl]b[FlLl]l = [O]
a+l=O; a=-1

Part (b) illustrates the way in which additional information, in this
case obtained from experiments, can be used to supplement the
results of the dimensional analysis.
EXAMPLE
3. A problem of considerable practical importance is
that of determining the drag force Fd acting upon a body moving
through a fluid. Consider a body of specified shape whose size is
defined by some characteristic length I, moving with a constant
velocity v through a fluid of density p and viscosity p. Apply
dimensional analysis to this problem.
Solution. The solution will be of the form f (Fd, v, I, p, p) = 0.
There are five variables and three fundamental units, so we expect
two m-terms. We are particularly concerned with the force F d SO
we shall select the n terms so that Fd will appear in only one.
Choosing the viscosity p as the other unique variable, the rr terms
become :
m l = Fdlapbvc; n2 = plapbVC

prominent part in many fluid mechanics problems. The form of the
function f would in general have to be determined experimentally,
and the above expressions would be helpful in suggesting the way in
which the experiments should be carried out and in organizing the
results of the tests.
1.8 The Theory of Models. The testing of a model for the
purpose of predicting the behavior of the prototype is a useful
technique in many fields of engineering. The principles on which
such models should be designed and tested may be established by a
direct application of dimensional analysis.
As a starting point it will be necessary to know all of the variables
which are important for the particular problem. The safest way to
be sure that all of the proper variables have been included is to derive
general equations that will apply to both model and prototype, but
this cannot always be done without more knowledge of the problem
than is readily available. Using the T theorem, the variables can
be arranged in dimensionless groups so that the equation assumes
the form:
+(TI, 772, . . . ) = 0
As shown above, each of the dimensionless terms will contain one
unique variable which does not appear in the other terms. The
equation can then be solved for the n factor involving the variable
which is of primary importance in the particular problem:
= e ( ~T3,
~ ., . . )
This is a general relationship which will apply both to the prototype
and to the model:

T H E GENERAL PRINCIPLES O F DYNAMICS

Equations (1.1) can be thought of as the conditions which specify the
design and method of testing of the model, whereas Equation (1.2)
permits a determination of prototype behavior in terms of the model
behavior.
EXAMPLE1. Show how to design and interpret tests on a model
to study the problem of the deflections of a beam under (a) its own
weight and (b) under a concentrated load, assuming that the weight
of the beam is negligible.
Solution. (a) From our knowledge of beam deflection theory we
know that the important variables are: the deflection 6, the weight
per unit volume y, the modulus of elasticity El some characteristic
length I , such as the length of the beam, various linear dimensions
(a, b, c, . . . ) to specify the point at which the deflection is desired
and the shape of the cross-section of the beam. Thus we have:
f ( & Y , E , l , a, b , c , . . . )

or in terms of the n-factors:

solving for the term involving the deflection

From the right hand side of this equation we see that the model must
be geometrically similar in all respects to the prototype, so that :

and in addition we must have :

Then the prototype behavior may be calculated from the model

Note that it will not be possible to make a model with a scale factor
different from unity with the same material as the prototype. For a

THE THEORY OF MODELS

19

given scale factor, a model material must be found which has a y and
E such that the yl/E condition is satisfied.
If we introduce the additional information that we are to be concerned only with small deflections for which there is a linear relationship between deflection and load, the general equation can be written
as :

(;)

=

In this case the only scale factors are the geometric conditions, and
it will no longer be necessary to limit the model material to satisfy a
yl/E requirement.
(b) If the deflections are caused by a concentrated load P instead
of by the uniformly distributed gravity load of part (a), the variables
are :
f ( S , P , E , l , a , b , c, . . . )

Besides the geometrical conditions there is now only one modeling
condition :

THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DYNAMICS

Thus the model should be scaled geometrically, and the Reynolds
number (plv/p) should be the same for the model test and for the
prototype.
If the fluid is t o be the same for the model and prototype, the
Reynolds number equality becomes :

and the prototype resisting force is:
F p =

Fm.

Note that the Reynolds number equality requires that a small
model should have a larger velocity than the prototype. I n aerodynamic model investigations this may lead to difficulties, since at
the high velocity demanded b y the Reynolds number equality the
nature of the physical phenomena may change. To obtain the
correct Reynolds number without a large increase in velocity, model
tests are sometimes made in wind tunnels in which the density of the
air has been increased b y pressurizing.

Chapter 2
KINEMATICS : THE DESCRIPTION OF MOTION

The circumstances of mere motion, considered without reference to the
bodies moved, or to the forces producing the motion, or t o the forces called
into action by the motion, constitute the subject of a branch of Pure Mathematics, which is called Kinematics.-W. Thomson and I). G. Tait, Elements of
Natural Philosophy ( 1872).

For the development of dynamics a concise and consistent notation
is required for the description of the displacements, velocities, and
accelerations of a body. The vector notation for these quantities
will be presented first, and then various scalar components of these
vectors will be developed.
2.1 Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration. The displacement of a point P (Fig. 2.1) is described by the magnitude and
direction of the radius vector r which extends from the origin of a
coordinate system to the point P. At time t let the displacement be
r then at time t + At the displacement is r + Ar where Ar is the
vector from P to P'. Between P and P' the average change of r per
unit time is Ar/At and the velocity at P is obtained by taking the
limiting value of Ar/At as At approaches zero:

The direction of v is tangent to the path of motion at P. At point P
the velocity is v , and at the point P' it is v + Av. The change of
velocity with time may be illustrated by a diagram in which the
velocity v is drawn as a radius vector as in Fig. 2.2. The curve
described by the endpoint of v in this figure is called the hodograph
26

DISPLACEMENT, VELOCITY, AND ACCELERATION

27

of the motion. Let the velocity be v at time t and v + A v a t time
t + At. In this interval the average change of velocity per unit
time is AvlAt, and the acceleration at time t is obtained by taking
the limiting value of AvlAt.

The direction of the acceleration vector a coincides with the direction
of the tangent to the hodograph, since the velocity of the endpoint
of a vector in the hodograph plane is the time derivative of the
vector. I t should be noted that the acceleration is equal to zero

28

KINEMATICS : THE DESCRIPTION OF MOTION

only when both the magnitude and direction of v are constant. For
example, a particle moving on a circular path can never have zero
acceleration since the direction of v is always changing.
I n vector notation the equation of motion is written: *

I t is often convenient to resolve the displacement, velocity and
acceleration vectors into components. These components are usually
taken in the principal directions of the coordinate system which is
most appropriate for the particular
Y
problem involved. Three commonly
used sets of components will now be dis- -- - - - - - cussed.

(a) Rectangular coordinates (Fig. 2.3)
are used to describe the displacement,

they are resolved into components
parallel to the orthogonal x y z axes.

(2.5)

where F,, F y , F, are the x, y, z components of the resultant force
acting on the particle.
(b) Cylindrical coordinates z , r, 4 are used when suited to the
geometry of the problem. In this system there are three mutually

components; one parallel to the z-axis, one with a
direction parallel to the radius vector in the xy plane, and the third
with the direction of increasing 4 as shown in Fig. 2.4 (a).
The unit vectors specifying these directions are designated by
ez, e, and e+. The unit vectors e, and e+ are not constant, but
change direction with time. The time derivative of a unit vector
is perpendicular to the vector since the length of the vector is
constant. As may be seen from Fig. 2.4 (b) :

differentiation :

KINEMATICS : T H E DESCRIPTION O F MOTION

The equation of motion is written:

where F,, FQ,F, are the components of the resultant force on the
particle in the r, 4, z directions, and ( Y - r42), (rd; + 2i4) and f are
the components of acceleration. Since the expressions for the
acceleration components are not as simple as for rectangular components, it is not desirable to use
cylindrical coordinates unless the
geometry of the problem is particularly suited to their use.
(c) Tangential and normal components are used chiefly because
they give a simple representation
of acceleration in curvilinear
motion. Let s be the arc length
measured along the path of
motion [Fig. 2.5 (a)] and let p be
the principal radius of curvature
a t the point P. The velocity is :

Substituting this value of Pt in the foregoing expression for a
gives :

The acceleration vector a may thus be resolved into two perpendicular components, a tangential acceleration of magnitude s and a
normal acceleration of magnitude - S2Ip. The minus sign indicates
that the direction of the normal acceleration is toward the center of
curvature.
The equations of motion in terms of tangential and normal
components of acceleration are :

Coordinate systems of other types may be found to be convenient
for certain problems. The spherical coordinate system discussed in
problems 2.3 and 2.4 below is often employed. I t is often wise to
compare the possibilities of several coordinate systems for a particular problem.

Fig. 2.7. The speed along the path is given by S = at. Find the
maximum acceleration of the particle.

radial and tangential components of acceleration suitable. Using

The

maximum acceleration will thus occur when S is a maximum on the
curved path, that is, just a t the end of the curve:

KINEMATICS : THE DESCRIPTION OF MOTION

The geometric axis of the helix is vertical. If the mass starts from rest
at t = 0 from the point z = 0 and 4 = 0,find the e,, eg, and e, components
of the force exerted by the particle on the helix as a function of time.
2.7. The third derivative of displacement with respect to time, the time
rate of change of acceleration, is sometimes called the "jerk" and is used
to evaluate the riding comfort of vehicles. Find the components of jerk
in the directions of the unit vectors in a cylindrical coordinate system.
2.8. A weight is lifted by a flexible cable wound on a cone as shown in
the figure. The diameter of the cable is d , and the diameter of the large

end of the cone is D. If the cone is rotated at a constant angular velocity
w , find the acceleration of the weight, neglecting the small horizontal
motion of the weight.

2.2 Angular Velocity. Consider a rigid body rotating about a
fixed axis OA, as shown in Fig. 2.8. B y the definition of rotation,
this means that all points of the body are moving in circular paths
about centers on the axis of rotation. The angular velocity of the
body is described by the vector o,which has the direction of the
axis of rotation as given by the right-hand screw rule and which has
a magnitude equal to the time rate of change of the angular displacement of any line in the body which is normal to the axis of
rotation. Thus in Fig. 2.8, w would have the direction of OA and
the magnitude :

There is a simple relation between the angular velocity of a rigid

ANGULAR VELOCITY

35

body rotating about a fixed axis and the linear velocity of any point
in the body. Referring to Fig. 2.8 and the definition of the angular
velocity, it will be seen that the
velocity v of a point P located
by the radius vector r is:

since v is perpendicular to the
plane of o and r and

I t should be noted that the
angular velocity vector is a free
vector, in the sense that it is
not associated with a particular
line of action, as is a force
vector.
An expression involving
angular velocity which will frequently be found useful is that which gives the time derivatives
of the unit vectors in a rotating coordinate system. In Fig. 2.9
the xyz coordinate system rotates with respect to a fixed XYZ

system with an angular velocity o. The unit vectors in the xyz directions are i, j , k, and we are to determine the time derivatives i, j, k

36

of these unit vectors. Referring to Equation (2.12) which we may
write as = w x r, we see that we may write:

with similar expressions f o r j and k. In this way the result is found
to be:
i = w x i = w Z j- w y k
j = w x j = w z k - wzi

cylinder and its absolute angular velocity.
2.3 Motion Referred to a Moving Coordinate System. Suppose that the position of a point P (Fig. 2.12) is determined with
respect to an xyz coordinate system, while at the same time this coordinate system moves with a translational velocity 8 and an angular
velocity o with respect to a "fixed" X Y Z coordinate system. This
is the type of coordinate system which might become necessary, for
example, in a long range ballistics problem for which the motion of
the earth would have to be taken into account. In such a problem

the measurements would be made with respect to the earth, and the
motion of the earth relative to some coordinate system fixed with
respect to certain stars would be considered. We shall now derive
a general expression for the acceleration of a point referred to a
coordinate system which itself is moving.
I n the analysis t o follow, we shall always measure the vectors
R and r in the fixed XYZ system. The unit vectors i, j, k always
have the direction of the moving coordinate axes, while the unit
vectors i', j', k' always have the direction of the fixed coordinate
axes.
By the absolute displacement r of the point P is meant the displacement measured with respect to the fixed XYZ system. By

MOTION O F A MOVING COORDINATE SYSTEM

39

differentiating this absolute displacement we obtain the absolute
velocity i. and the absol~teacceleration r.

+ Yj' + Zk'
+ Yj' + 2 k '
i: = Xi' + Ifj' +tk
%
.'
r = Xi'
i. = Xi'

During these differentiations, the unit vectors it,j', k' are treated as
constants, since neither their magnitudes nor their directions change
with time.
If we wish to express the absolute motion in terms of motion
measured in the moving xyz system, we have :

where the directions of the i, j , k unit vectors are known with respect
to the fixed system. However, the unit vectors are changing
direction with time, since they rotate with the xyz system. In taking
the derivatives i. and i.', therefore, the time derivatives of these unit
vectors must be included:

i.=R+~=R+~i+xi+yj++j+ik+zk
The derivatives of the unit vectors are given by Equations (2.13) :
so that

+ (xi + y j + i k ) + w

i. =

x (xi

+ y j + zk)

The quantity (Ri + y j + i k ) represents the velocity of the point P,
measured relative to the moving coordinate system, which we shall
call the relative velocity p,. Using this notation, the expression for P
becomes :
P=R+(j,+wxp
(2.15)
and it is seen that p

=

p,

+w

x p.

The acceleration of P may be found by a second differentiation:
i: = #

+ ij

=

#

+ (xi + jij + fk) + (xi + jj + ik)
+ cj x (xi + y j + zk) + w x (xi + y j + i k ) ,

+

40

KINEMATICS : T H E DESCRIPTION O F MOTION

Writing ( X i + yj + Pk) = 6, which we call the relative acceleration
of the point P, the expression for i: can be written:
i: = # + o x (O x p) + 8 x p + P;, + 2 0 x pr (2.16)
The first three terms in this expression for r represent the absolute
acceleration of a point attached to the moving coordinate system,
coincident with the point P at any given time. This may be seen
by noting that for a point fixed in the moving system pr = pr = 0.
The fourth term pr represents the acceleration of P relative to the
moving system. The last term 2w x p, is sometimes called the
acceleration of Coriolis, after G. Coriolis (1792-1843)) a French
engineer who first called attention to this term.

The equation of motion in terms of the moving coordinate system
may thus be written:

Some applications of this equation will be given in the chapter on
rigid body dynamics.
EXAMPLE
1. TWOconcentric disks of radius r and R rotate about
the same fixed center 0, as shown in Fig. 2.13. The constant angular
velocity of the large disk, measured in a fixed system, is Q. The
constant angular velocity of the small disk relative to the large disk,
measured in a coordinate system attached to the large disk, is w.
Find the acceleration of the point A , on the circumference of the
small disk, and indicate the Coriolis acceleration term in this problem.

MOTION O F A MOVING COORDINATE SYSTEM

41

Solution. We shall solve this simple problem in two ways, as a
means of gaining a thorough insight into the kinematics of relative
motion. We shall first use Equation (2.16), taking the coordinate
systems as shown in Fig. 2.14. The X Y system is fixed, with the
origin at the center of rotation. The moving xy system is attached
to the large disk with its origin at the center of rotation, and hence
has an angular velocity Rk. Then we have:

where in this problem:

#

=

0,

(0

=

Qk, p = rj, O

=

0, jrr = -rwi,andpr

= -rw?

Thus we obtain :

As a second method of solution, we may note that if the angular
velocity of the small disk with respect to the large disk is o,and if
the large disk has an absolute angular velocity Q, then the absolute
angular velocity of the small disk is (w + Q). The absolute velocity
of the point A is thus r(w + R). Since the angular velocities are
constant, the only acceleration component is the normal vz/r component, as given by Equation (2.10). Thus we have :

as in the first solution.
I t will be evident from this solution that the Coriolis acceleration
term - 2rwRj is just the cross-product term which is the consequence
of squaring a sum. Since the expressions for velocity do not involve
squares, no term corresponding to the Coriolis acceleration term
appears in them.
EXAMPLE
2. A small body of mass m slides on a rod which is the
chord of a circular wheel, as in Fig. 2.15. The wheel rotates about
its center 0 with a clockwise angular velocity w = 4 rad/sec, and a
clockwise angular acceleration a = 5 rad/sec2. The body m has a
constant velocity of 6 ft/sec to the right, relative to the wheel. Find
the absolute acceleration of m when p = 1.5 ft if R = 3 ft.
Soldon. We shall fix the moving xyz coordinate system to the

system is o = 4 rad/sec k and the angular acceleration cb = 5 rad/

the terms may be evaluated as follows:

In some problems of this type the sum of the first three terms
(# + o x (w x p) + cb x p) can be computed more directly by
noting that this vector sum represents the absolute acceleration of a
fixed point on the moving coordinate system which is coincident with
the moving point. In the present problem, for example, this coincident-point acceleration is (Fig. 2.16) :

which will be seen to be equal to the sum of the first three vectors
of the solution by the other method.

DYNAMICS OF A PARTICLE

Newton admits nothing but what he gains from experiments and accurate
observations. From this foundation, whatever is further advanced, is
deduced by strict mathematical reasoning.-William Emerson, The Principles
of Mechanics (1754)

The equation of motion as given in Chapter 1 is theoretically
sufficient for the solution of any of the solvable problems of classical
mechanics. There are several other ways, however, of presenting
the basic information contained in this equation. Each of these
has advantages for the solution of certain types of problems. In the
present chapter we shall first show, in some simple examples, how
the equation of motion can be integrated directly to give the solution
of certain types of problems, and we shall then discuss some other
forms in which the equation of motion can be expressed.
The problems treated in this chapter will be restricted to the
dynamics of a particle. If rotational effects can be neglected for a
particular body, then that body can be treated as though it were a
single particle with the mass of the body concentrated a t one point.*
If the rotational effects need to be considered, then the problem
must be treated by the more general methods of rigid body dynamics.
I t should be noted that the same body might in one problem behave
as a particle, while in another problem it might have to be treated
as a rigid body. For example, a cannon ball shot through the air
could be treated as a particle; the same ball rolled along the ground
would have to be considered as a rigid body of a given radius.

* See Section 6.2, Chapter 6.

49

In general, we shall consider any body as being made up of a
number of particles, so that, once the basic laws describing the motion
of a particle have been established, the theory may be extended to
any body without the introduction of new principles. By first
studying the behavior of a single particle, the various laws of
dynamics can be exhibited in their simplest form, unencumbered
with the purely mathematical difficulties involved in the description
of complex motions.
3.1 Integration of the Equation of Motion for Particular
Problems. In many problems the known quantities and the
information desired are such that a direct integration of the equation
F = my, expressed in an appropriate coordinate system, will
give the solution.
EXAMPLE
1. Consider a particle, of mass m, which at time
t = 0 is projected horizontally
with an initial velocity x o , and is
subsequently acted upon by 7
gravity and by air resistance.
Find the position and velocity of
the particle at any subsequent
time.
Solution. Fig. 3.1 shows a freebody diagram of the particle with
all the forces acting. The drag
force produced by air resistance has been resolved into two rectangular components, and the gravity force is shown as a downward
force mg. To describe the motion we choose a rectangular xy coordinate system with the xy plane coinciding with the plane of
motion. In this system the equation F = mi: becomes:

In general, the drag forces D, and D,will be functions of the velocities
2 and y, and these functions must be known before the equations

can be integrated. In a later section we shall consider the nature of
these functions and methods of integrating the resulting equations.

DYNAMICS O F A PARTICLE

For the present, as an illustration of the general method in its
simplest form, let us suppose that the motion is taking place in a
vacuum, so that D, = D, = 0. Then:

x=o
y = -g
Integrating once:
1 = C1
j = -gt+C:!

The constants of integration can be determined from the initial
conditions x = i O ,y = 0 when t = 0 ; hence:
C1 = io

Cz

Performing a second integration:

Also, when t = 0 ; x = 0, y = 0, so C3 = C4 = 0, and we have the
result :
X = got

By eliminating t, the relationship between x and y is found:

and the path of motion is found to be a parabola.
EXAMPLE
2. J. V. Poncelet (1829) concluded on the basis of tests
that when a projectile of mass m is fired into earth or masonry it
experiences a retarding force FD = - C I - C2v2,where the constants
C1 and Cz depend on the properties of the material and the shape of
the projectile. If the impact velocity of the projectile is vo, find the

After t = 6 sec, F = 0. If the velocity of the particle is 25 ftlsec when
t = 0, find the velocity of the particle and the distance that it has traveled
at t = 8 sec.

3.7. A particle of mass m starts from rest and slides down the side of a
hemispherical surface of radius r under the action of gravity. If there is
no friction, and the particle starts from A , what force will be exerted on
the surface by the particle at the instant when it is located at B ?

3.2 The Equatiom of Impulse and Momentum. If the force
acting upon a particle is specified as a function of time, the direct
integration of the equation of motion, as illustrated in the preceding
section, will give the solution of the problem. If a complete specification of the forces is not available, it may still be possible to obtain
some information about the motion by obtaining a general first
integral of the equation of motion. Two such general integrals
can be obtained and we shall first derive the time integral.

54

DYNAMICS OF A PARTICLE

Eeginning with the equation of motion in the form:

F

=

mi:

and multiplying both sides by dt and integrating, we obtain :

The term

i:

F dt is called the im*ulse of the force F and the term

(mv) is called the momentum of the particle. Equation (3.1) thus
states that the impulse is equal to the change in the momentum.
Both impulse and momentum are vector quantities and hence can
be written in terms of components in various coordinate systems.
I n rectangular components, for example, the equations are:

It should be noted that the impulse-momentum equation is but
another form of the equation of motion and that it furnishes no new
information, although its use may simplify the solution of certain
problems. I n some problems the impulse applied to the system may
be known whereas the forces are unknown. In such a problem the
impulse-momentum equation gives the change of velocity directly.
If no force acts upon a particle, the equation of impulse-momentum
is :
mv2 - mvl = 0
mv2 = m v ~
If no impulse is acting there is no change in momentum, and the
momentum of the system may be said to be conserved.
Consider two particles of mass ma and mb which exert a mutual
action upon each other as, for example, in a collision. From the
Third Law of Motion we know that the forces, and hence the impulses experienced by ma and mb during this mutual interaction are
equal and opposite. The total impulse for the system of two particles
is thus zero, and hence the total change in momentum of the system

T H E EQUATION O F IMPULSE AND MOMENTUM

55

must be zero. We may thus state that the total momentum is a
constant :
mava + mbvb = constant

If there are more than two particles involved and all the forces
acting upon the particles are due to mutual interactions, that is, there
are no external forces applied to the system, we can say:
Cmlvt

=

constant

This is a vector equation and in rectangular coordinates its components are:
Em& = constant, etc
This is the Princi$le of the Conservation of Momentum, which holds
for any system upon which no external forces are acting.
An extension of the above concept of the momentum vector leads
to the definition of the moment of momentum vector, and to the
principle of the conservation of moment of momentum. These ideas
will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
EXAMPLE
1. Rain falls steadily at the rate of 1 in./hr. If the
terminal velocity of the raindrops is 20 ftlsec, find the average force
per unit area on a horizontal surface caused by vertically falling
rain.
Solution. The average force will be equal to the average rate of
change of momentum, which can be calculated if it is assumed that
the amount of water that is splashed upwards is negligible:

3. A gun whose barrel makes an angle a with the

so that recoil takes place with no resistive forces. The total mass of
the gun is M and the mass of the shell is m. Find the recoil velocity
V of the gun, and the magnitude of the absolute velocity of the shell
as it leaves the gun.
Solution. Since there are no horizontal forces acting on the system
of the gun, shell, and explosive gases, the horizontal momentum of
the system is conserved. This horizontal momentum is initially
zero, so, neglecting the small momentum of the explosive gases, we
have :
m(v, cos a - V) - M V = 0

3.3 The Equation of Work and
Energy. The first integral of the
equation of motion with respect to time gives the equation of impulse
and momentum. We shall now derive the first integral of the equation of motion with respect to displacement.
We start with the equation of motion in the form:
PROB.
3.15

F

=

mi:

Forming the dot product of each side with the displacement dr, and
integrating, we obtain:

The integral on the left side of this equation is called the work done
by t h e force F, and the term fmv2 is called the kinetic epzergy of the
particle. Thus the equation states that the work done upon the mass
m by the force F is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of the
mass.
The vector displacement dr is tangent to the path of motion of the
particle, so that the scalar product F.dr represents the component

59

THE EQUATION OF WORK AND ENERGY

of the force in the direction of the displacement multiplied by the
displacement. The total work done by the force in moving along a

F.dr.

path from A to B (Fig. 3.2) is given by the line integral
/AB

Expanding the dot product in terms of rectangular coordinates we
have :
Work =

[(F,d z + F, d y + Fa dz)

The rate of work, F.dr/dt = Fa v, is called the9ower. I t should be
noted that work, kinetic energy, and power are scalar quantities, as

defined by the dot-products, and are completely specified by their
magnitudes.
Since the equation of work and energy is simply a restatement of
the original law of motion, it cannot furnish any new information.
In many problems, however, the work-energy equation leads directly
to simple solutions.
EXAMPLE.
A mass m falls through a distance h and strikes the
end of a linear spring, as shown in Fig. 3.3. The spring constant is
k Ib/in., that is, it requires a force of kx Ib to compress or extend the
spring x in. Find the maximum compression of the spring.
Solution. The forces acting on the mass are the gravity force mg
and the spring force ( - kx). If 6 is the maximum compression of the

60

DYNAMICS OF A PARTICLE

spring, the total work done by the forces acting on the mass from its
initial position to the final fully compressed position is:
Work = mg(h + 6) Since the velocity of the mass is initially zero, and is zero again a t
the instant of maximum spring compression, the change in kinetic
energy is zero, and hence the work done is also zero, and we have :

mg(h + 6) - 4k62

=

0

The deflection corresponding to a static force equal to the weight of
the body is (mglk). Calling this the static dejection, 6,t, we have:

initial tension. At contact the propeller pitch is reversed to exert a

must be done against the gravitational force if the projectile is to reach a

what initial velocity must the projectile have in order to reach that
distance ? What initial velocity must the projectile have to escape from
the earth's gravitational field ? Take the radius of the earth as 4000 mi.

63

POTENTIAL

3.4 Potential. The equation of work-energy for a particle of
mass m acted upon by a force F is:

The right side of this equation depends only upon the velocities of the
particle at the two end-points A and B. The value of the left side,
however, will depend in general upon the path of integration followed

F . d r will

between A and B. The value of the line integral
/AB

depend only upon the limits of integration and not upon the path
only if ( F a a x )is an exact differential. If this is so, there exists some
function @ such that d @ = F . d r and :

If the function @ exists, the force F is said to be derivable from a
potelzbial, for:
F.dr = F,dx + F,dy + F,dz

From which :

This potential function is called aforcefunction.
When a force is derivable from a potential, the work done by the
force is independent of the path of motion and depends only upon the
end-points of the path. Since @ is a function of the space coordinates only, the magnitude and direction of the force are completely determined when its point of application is known. This will
be true if the force is a function of the displacement only. If the
force is a function of velocity, it cannot be derived from a potential,
and the line integral representing the work is not independent of the
path of integration.
The concept of a potential function has much wider application
than is suggested by the force potential. In fluid mechanics, for
example, it is customary to define a velocity potential whose

64

DYNAMICS OF A PARTICLE

derivatives give the components of velocity, and in thermodynamics several potential functions are defined whose derivatives
give certain thermodynamic variables.
3.5 Potential Energy. Suppose that a force F , which is derivable from a potential, acts upon a particle that moves from point
A to point B. We define the change in the potential energy of the
force, (VB - VA),as the negative of the work done by the force as it
moves from A to B.

To specify the potential energy a t a point it is necessary to select a
datum point a t which the potential energy is arbitrarily set equal to
zero. Taking some point D as the datum point, we have VLI= 0
and :

(3.5)
The datum point D is selected at any point that is convenient for
the particular problem being considered.
From the definition it is seen that the potential energy is the
negative of the force function since F s d r = - dV. The components
of the force may thus be expressed in terms of the potential energy
in the same way in which they were expressed in terms of the force
function, and we have:

The only difference between the potential energy V and the force
function cD, other than sign, is that the potential energy usually
involves an additive constant, since it is defined with respect to an
arbitrarily chosen datum point; V = - @ + C. The advantage of
using a potential as a description of a force is that it permits an
analysis of the force without bringing into the picture the mechanism
causing the force or the bodies upon which the force acts. This
advantage is particularly useful for forces which act at a distance,
such as gravitational and electrical forces.
If a force is not derivable from apotential function, as,for example,
frictional forces or forces proportional to velocity, it is not possible
to define a potential energy.

T H E CONSERVATION O F ENERGY

65

3.6 The Conservation of Energy. If a particle is acted upon
by a force which has a potential energy V, the equation of workenergy gives :

This equation states that the s u m of the potential and the kinetic energy
remains constant. The energy is said to be conserved and we have:
V

+ 4mvz = constant

(3.6)

This is the principle of the conservation of mechanical energy. I t is
valid for any system for which a potential energy can be defined.
Any system to which the principle
of conservation of energy applies
is said to be a conservative system,
and the forces are said to be conservative forces. I t should be
noted that the principle of the
conservation of energy is a direct
consequence of Newton's Laws
and the definitions of the terms
involved. I t introduces no new
FIG.3.4
physical facts into the science of
mechanics.
The principle of conservation of energy is applicable only when the
forces of a system have potential energies. If this is not true, for
example, if frictional forces are acting, the system is said to be nonconservative and the equation of work-energy must be used. The
equation of work-energy is thus more general. The use of the
principle of conservation of energy is, however, very convenient
where conservative systems are involved.
EXAMPLE
1. A mass m is supported on a frictionless inclined
plane which makes an angle a with the horizontal by a linear spring
of spring constant k as shown in Fig. 3.4. Find the potential energy
of the system as a function of the displacement x of the mass along
the plane, where x is measured from the position of static equilibrium.

66

DYNAMICS OF A PARTICLE

Assume that the potential energy is zero at the position of static
equilibrium.
Solution. The potential energy is the negative of the work done
by the forces acting on the mass as it moves from the static equilibrium position. These forces are the component of the gravity force
parallel to the plane, and the spring force F,. The initial force in
the spring at the static equilibrium position is (mgsin a),and so the
spring force at any displacement x is :

F,

=

(mgsin a

+ kx)

Thus we have :

(mg sin a

+ kx) dx

Note that the angle a drops out of the final expression for the potential
energy. Thus if x is measured from the position of static equilibrium, the potential energy of the spring-mass system will always be
just ikxz, whether the spring is horizontal, vertical, or inclined at an
angle.
EXAMPLE
2. The mass of Fig. 3.4 is moved a distance A along
the plane from the position of static equilibrium and is then released
from rest. Write the equation of conservation of energy for the
system and apply this equation to a discussion of the motion of the
mass.
Solution. Since there is no friction and the gravity force and the
spring force are conservative, the principle of conservation of energy
applies :
V+T=C
As was shown in Example 1, V = ikx2, so:
ikx2

+ imvz

=

C

In this problem, when x = A , v = 0, so C
finally :
ikx2 + imv2 = i k A 2

=

hkA2 and we have

When the body is at x = 0, the kinetic energy is equal to i k A 2 , so
that the body oscillates between x = + A and x = - A . The
energy is all kinetic energy at x = 0 and all potential energy at
x = $ A . The sum of the energies is always a constant, but there
is a transfer of energy between kinetic and potential.

3.7 The Solution of Problems in Dynamics. The solution of
any problem in dynamics involves, in some form or another, the
integration of the equation F = mi.'. For problems in which the
forces are specified and the velocities and displacements are required
as a function of time, the direct integration of this equation may be
the most convenient method of procedure. In other problems, some
labor may be saved by using the work-energy equation or the impulse-

THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS I N DYNAMICS

69

momentum equation. The decision as to which of these forms to use
for a particular problem will depend upon the given data and the
desired result. As the first step in solving a dynamics problem it is
well to review the given data, the required result, and the various
dynamic equations from the standpoint of determining which method
will be the most suitable.
Some of the characteristics of the methods which should be considered in this connection are :

(1) The impulse-momentum equation involves the velocity
and force at specified times. Displacements do not
appear in the expression.
(2) The impulse-momentum equation is useful for problems
involving large forces of indeterminate magnitudes
acting' for short times. A consideration of timeaverage values of the forces may suffice to solve such
problems.
(3) The principle of the conservation of momentum can be
used only for systems not acted upon by external forces.
This principle is most useful when it can be recognized
that by treating several bodies together as a system
certain unknown forces will occur as equal and opposite
pairs and will thus cancel.
(4) The work-energy equation involves velocity and force at
specified displacements. Time does not appear in the
expression.
(5) The principle of the conservation of energy is applicable
only to systems for which a potential energy can be
defined.
(6) Potential energy is defined only for forces which can be
derived from potential functions. Forces, such as
friction, which cause a dissipation of energy, have no
potential.
(7) The work-energy equation is more general than the
equation of the conservation of energy in that it applies
to non-conservative systems as well as conservative
systems.

APPLICATIONS OF PARTICLE DYNAMICS

An intelligent being who knew for a given instant all the forces by which
nature is animated and possessed complete information on the state of matter
of which nature consists-providing his mind were powerful enough to analyze
these data-could express in the same equation the motions of the largest
bodies of the universe and the motion of the smallest atoms. Nothing would
be uncertain for him, and he would see the future as well as the past a t one
glance.-Marquis de Laplace, Thborie analytique des Probabilitks (1820).

The principles of particle dynamics as developed in the preceding
chapter can be applied to the solution of a large number of interesting
and important problems. In the present chapter the solution of such
problems as the motion of a particle in a resisting medium, projectile
motion, planetary motion, impact, jet propulsion, and electron
dynamics will be given. These solutions will illustrate the application of the general principles to particular problems. I t should be
noted, however, that, although the principles involved in most
problems in mechanics are relatively simple, the differential equations
that are obtained may be of a type which cannot be integrated by
elementary methods.
4.1 The Motion of a Body Falling Through a Resisting
Medium. In the preceding chapter the equations of motion were
integrated for a body falling in a vacuum. I t was also indicated at
that point that such a solution is approximate for a body falling
through a resisting medium. Experiment shows that frictional
forces exert a drag which depends upon the shape of the body, the
velocity of the body, and the density and viscosity of the medium.*

* The drag force depends upon Reynolds number; see Example 3 of
Section 1.7, Chapter 1.
75

76

APPLICATIONS OF PARTICLE DYNAMICS

In general there is a certain optimum shape for which the drag is a
minimum.
We shall suppose for the present example that the drag force is
proportional to the velocity, FD =
- kv. Experimentally it is found that
0
z this expression is satisfactory for small
velocities. The factor k must be
determined experimentally. Choosing
the positive z-axis in the vertical downward direction (Fig. 4.1), we have for
a particle of mass m and weight W :

77

When the limiting value

f ) = 1 is reached, k f = W; that is, the drag force has become

equal to the weight of the body. The resultant force acting upon
the body is then equal to zero; hence, there is no acceleration and
consequently no further increase in velocity. It will be seen that
whenever the drag increases with velocity, a point will be reached
a t which the drag is equal t o the weight and there will be no subsequent increase in velocity. This limiting value of velocity is
called the terminal velocity of the body.
We have supposed, in this example, that the falling body moves
through a medium of uniform density. Since the density of the
atmosphere decreases with altitude, the drag force must also be a
function of the altitude, and this additional factor would have t o be
included in the analysis if a more accurate solution were required
for a large altitude range.

PROBLEMS
4.1. A body of weight W falls through a resisting medium in which the
drag is proportional to the velocity. Find the displacement at any time,
assuming that zo = lo = 0 when t = 0.
4.2. For velocities above approximately 100 ft/sec, the drag force is
approximately described by taking it as proportional to the square of the
velocity, FD = - kv2. Proceeding in the same way as above for drag
proportional to velocity, integrate the equation of motion and find the
velocity and displacement of a falling body at any time t, if zo = lo = 0
when t = 0.
4.3. What is the terminal velocity for a falling body subjected to a drag
proportional to velocity squared ?
4.4. Determine the velocity with which a rain drop would strike the
ground falling from a height of 1 mi. if air resistance is neglected. If
measurements show that the terminal velocity of the rain drop is approximately 20 ft/sec, find the drag constant k , assuming FD = - k v . How
far does the rain drop fall before its velocity is within 0.1% of the terminal
velocity ?
4.5 The relation s = -k(S)n is assumed to describe the motion of a
certain body in a viscous medium.
(a) If the body has an initial velocity, vo, find the highest value of n for
which it is brought to rest within a finite period of time. Find the time

(h) Find the highest value of n for which the total distance traversed
by the body before it comes to rest is finite.
(c) Find the distance traveled by the bodv for n = 1.
4.6. An airplane weighing 20,000 lbs starts from rest and accelerates
along a horizontal runway. Acting on the airplane is a constant propulsion force of 2500 lbs, and a drag force Fd = -0.04~2 Ib where a is in
ft/sec. How long a run must the plane make if it takes off at 150 mph?

4.2 Projectile Motion. The preparation of ballistic tables
requires precise calculations of the trajectories, velocities, and times
of flight of projectiles. The chief difficulty in making such calculations arises from the fact that the drag is a complicated function of
the velocity. For purposes of illustration some simplified problems
that are amenable to a mathematiY
cal treatment will be considered.
We shall suppose that the projectile
remains sufficiently close to the
earth so that g may be taken as a
constant,
and we shall neglect the
\
\
rotation
of
the earth and any spin
\'
0
or other motion of the projectile as
FIG.4.3
a rigid body. All these factors
would have to be taken into account
in a precise calculation of the trajectory of a long-range projectile
or guided missile.
Consider first the two-dimensional motion of a projectile with
zero drag. Let the projectile have an initial velocity vo making an
angle 8 with the x-axis of the rectangular coordinate system of Fig.
4.3. The equations of motion are:
mx = 0
my = - mg
Integrating these equations and evaluating the constants in terms of
the initial conditions, we obtain:
x = (vocos 8)t
y = - igt2 + (VO sin 8)t
The equation for the trajectory is obtained by eliminating t from
these equations :

"

PROJECTILE MOTION

79

which shows that the trajectory is a parabola. All the significant
features of the motion can be determined from these equations.
A more practical approach to the ballistic problem must take into
account the effect of air resistance. This leads to a complex mathematical problem which is usually solved by numerical integration or
by special computing machines. A few special problems can be
treated by simpler mathematical procedures, and it is one of these
which we shall treat in the following example. For an intermediate
range of velocities, of approximately 100 to 1000 ftlsec, it may be
assumed that the drag force is approximately proportional to the
square of the velocity. If we further assume that the variation in

altitude of the projectile is small, so that variations in air density
may be neglected, we may write the equations of motion as (Fig. 4.4) :

my

=

-

kv2

sin 4 - mg

Since the problem of solving these equations is a complex one, we
shall simplify them by restricting the problem to a consideration of
relatively flat trajectories for which the ratio

(i)

is small. This is

consistent with the assumption that the variation in altitude of the
projectile is small. I t may be seen from Fig. 4.4, that small values
of

0
-:

mean that the slope of the trajectory is small everywhere.

APPLICATIONS O F PARTICLE DYNAMICS

80

z 1, and the differential

With this assumption we have
equations become :
mf = - kx2
my =

- k i y - mg

From these equations a relatively simple solution can be obtained
which is satisfactory over a limited range of trajectories. The first
equation can readily be solved by separating the variables:

When t

=

0, i = ioso that C1 =

1
thus:
xo

- -,

Substituting this value of x into the second differential equation
gives :

This equation is a linear differential equation for which the principle
of superposition is valid, that is, if two expressions are found each
of which satisfies the equation, then the sum of the two expressions
will satisfy the equation. The equation may thus be solved in two
steps. Consider first the homogeneous equation, with the right side

PROJECTILE MOTION

equal to zero instead of
and we have:

- g.

81

The variables can then be separated

( +-

J;

+ 1% C2

This expression is not the complete solution, however, because it
gives zero instead of - g when substituted into the original differential equation. We must therefore add to this solution a term which
will give - g when substituted into the differential equation.
If, on the basis of an inspection of the differential equatibn, we
try an expression of the form:

we obtain upon substituting this into the differential equation:

So that the complete solution of the equation is:

If y

= yo

and :

when t

0, then:

82

APPLICATIONS O F PARTICLE DYNAMICS

So that

This expression may now be checked by substituting it into the
differential equation and verifying that the equation is satisfied.
The equations for i and y can be integrated to obtain expressions
for x and y.
I t must be kept in mind that these equations are satisfactory onljr
for trajectories which satisfy the assumed condition that

($)is small.

The method of obtaining approximate solutions by dropping small
terms from a differential equation is often a convenient procedure.
The justification for it is that an analytical expression is obtained for
the solution which is approximately correct over a particular range
of interest in the variables. It might otherwise be necessary to
perform a numerical or graphical integration which would not only
be very laborious, but which would probably not exhibit the answer
in a general form. Simplifications of this type will always have a
physical interpretation which should be studied carefully, so that
the exact nature of the limitations on the solution will be known.
I n the above example, the approximation is deduced by noting that
there is only a small angle between the resisting force and the
x-axis. From the differential equations in their simplified form we
can see that this is equivalent to saying that the small vertical
velocity has no effect upon the horizontal drag, but that the large
horizontal velocity does have an effect upon the vertical drag.
Such solutions must, of course, be used with caution.

PROBLEMS
4.7. Two particles are projected from the same point with the same
magnitude of velocity but with different angles of elevation, as shown in
the diagram. The second particle is fired a time At later than the first
particle. What is the relation between v, el, BE, and At for which the two
particles will collide? Assume zero drag.
4.8. Find the maximum range and the angle 19 for the maximum, if the
range is measured along a 45' slope, as shown in the diagram, and zero
drag is assumed.

4.9. In section 4.2 the equations are given for the x and y components of
the velocity of a projectile which is subjected to a drag force proportional
to the square of the velocity. These components were worked out for a

a flat trajectory for which the ratio

(9

is small. From these expressions

find the x and y coordinates of the projectile as a function of time, under
the same assumption of a flat trajectory.
4.10. Assume that the total drag on an airplane is propcrtional to the
square of the velocity. With a feathered propeller, the plane is put into
a straight glide making an angle a with the horizontal. What is the
expression for the velocity of the plane ? What is the expression for the
terminal velocity ?
4.11. For a relatively slow-speed projectile, the air drag force can be
assumed to be proportional to the velocity. Find the horizontal distance
which such a projectile must travel before the tangent to the trajectory
becomes horizontal.
4.12. A body weighing 300 lb is projected with an initial speed of
120 mph up a straight track sloping 60" from the horizontal. The

84

APPLICATIONS O F PARTICLE DYNAMICS

coefficient of friction between the body and the track is 0.15, and it is
subjected to an aerodynamic drag force Fd = - 0.09~2Ib (v in ftlsec).
How far will the body travel ?

4.3 Planetary Motion. As an example of a two-dimensional
motion of a particle under the action of a central force, we shall
consider the problem of planetary motion. This problem is particularly interesting as an example of the method of deducing general
laws from experimental observations. By studying a large amount

of experimental data, Kepler determined the following three facts
about the motions of the planets:*

( 1 ) T h e orbit of each planet i s a n ellipse with the sun at a focus.
(2) T h e radius vector drawn from the s u n to the planet sweeps
over equal areas in equal times.
(3) T h e squares of the periods of the planets are proportional to
the cubes of the semi-major axes of the elliptical orbit.
I t will be of interest to see how, from these statements of empirical
facts, Newton was able to deduce the law of gravitation.?
Using the notation of Fig. 4.5, Kepler's three statements may be
written analytically in the form:

* J. Kepler (1571-1630). The first two statements were published in
1609, and the third in 1619.
t Certain letters of Newton indicate the methods he used.

PLANETARY MOTION

This is the equation of an ellipse in polar coordinates.

(3) T2/a3 = constant, where T is the period of a complete revolution.
In plane polar coordinates, the equations of motion of the planet
are :
Fe = m(2i8 + 70)
F , = m(7 - r@)
Differentiating (2) above gives:
728

=k

A second differentiation gives :
2id

+ rB' = 0

It thus appears that Fe = 0, and we conclude that the force on the
planet must be radial.
The radial force can be determined by differentiating (I), proceeding as follows:
Y =

1: =

P

1 + e cos 8
pe sin 8

(1 + ecos 8)2

In this expression for f , substitute

r28

+ e cos 0) = P-7

obtaining :

Differentiating this expression again, and substituting
have :

From the equation of the orbit cos 0 =

728 =

k, we

86

APPLICATIONS OF PARTICLE DYNAMICS

The expression for the radial force may thus be written:

and the magnitude of the radial force is inversely $roportional to the
square of the distance.
The force is now completely determined except for the factor k2,
which may depend upon the mass of the planet and the mass of the
sun. From Kepler's second statement, we have for one complete
period T:

From Kepler's third statement, that (a3/Tz) is the same for all of
the planets, it is clear that its value depends only upon the sun.
Since the force is directly proportional to the mass of the planet, we
assume it is also directly proportional to the mass of the sun. Writing
y m ~= - 4+(a3/T2), where mz is the mass of the sun, we have:

where m l is the mass of the planet, and y is a gravitational constant.
Newton tested this result by computing, from the motion of the
moon about the earth, the gravitational acceleration a t the earth's
surface. He then was able to check the computation against
observed values.

PROBLEMS
4.13. Compute the value of the acceleration of gravity g from the motion
of the moon about the earth, and compare this with values experimentally
determined at the earth's surface. Take the radius of the earth as
R = 3950 miles, the radius of the moon's orbit as 60R, and the period of
the moon revolving about the earth as 39,000 minutes. The gravitational

4.15. Given that the radius of the earth is 3950 miles, the radius of the
moon is 1080 miles, the distance from the center of the earth to the center

4.20. A particle of mass m is projected with a velocity vo along a line
which is at a distance s from a fixed identical particle. There is a repulsive force F = Ko/r2, where r is the distance between the particles at any
instant. Find the closest approach ro between the two particles. The
velocity vo is the velocity of the particle at a large distance from the fixed
particle, i.e., the trajectory shown in the figure is really asymptotic to the
lines shown a t the angle 4. Note that the trajectory is symmetrical
about the line AB. This problem may be considered as a type of impact
or collision, and will be discussed from this point of view in Section 4.5
of this chapter.
4.4 Impact. The problem of impact between two bodies is
characterized b y the presence of forces of large magnitude and short

'

89

IMPACT

time duration. Because of these forces sudden changes occur in the
velocities of the bodies, and it is these velocity changes which are
ordinarily observed and measured in impact experiments. If the
forces acting on the bodies were known, the solution of an 'impact
problem would require only the integration of the equation of motion.
Experimental difficulties, however, make the precise measurement of
impact forces difficult, so that a different method of solution of the
problem is usually required. The motion of the bodies during impact
must always satisfy the momentum equation, the energy equation,
and the third law of motion, that action is equal and opposite to
reaction. These are sufficient to determine all the features of the
motion except those occurring during the time of impact. Since the
impact time interval is usually very short, of the order of milliseconds, only small errors are introduced by assuming an instantaneous impact. If the time interval of impact is not short, the
approximate nature of the solution
must be kept in mind.
As an illustration of the methods 2-(&
used in solving impact problems,
consider two smooth spherical
bodies colliding with velocities v l
and v 2 as in Fig. 4.6. At imFIG.4.6
pact two equal and opposite forces
act normal to the surface of each sphere a t the point of contact.
The location and the direction of the forces can be determined from
the geometry of the problem, and hence the locations and directions
of the impulses Il and Z2 acting on the spheres are known. These
impulses will be equal and opposite:
11= - 1 2 = 1

"0

and the impulse-momentum relations for the two masses are:

where V1, V2 are the velocities after impact. Each of these vector
equations is equivalent to 3 scalar equations, and we thus have
6 equations available. There are, however, 7 unknowns in the

90

APPLICATIONS O F PARTICLE DYNAMICS

problem: the three unknown components of the two velocities after
impact, and the magnitude of the impulse. The additional equation
that is required can be obtained from energy considerations. If, for
example, the impact is perfectly elastic with no energy loss, then the
equation of the conservation of energy must also be satisfied, so that:

+ +m2v22 =

imlv12

+ irn~V2~

4mlV1~

In this discussion rotation of the spheres was not involved, so that the
spheres were treated as particles. If rotation existed, as in the
collision of rough spheres, the angular velocities of the spheres would
be involved, and the momentum and energy equations for the angular
motions would have to be considered.
Whenever there is an impact between actual bodies, there is
always some loss of energy. If the impact velocity is small, this
energy loss, for many purposes, may be neglected and the equation of
conservation of energy may be used as above. If, however, the
impact forces are sufficiently large to produce permanent deformations of the bodies, the work done in producing these deformations
represents an energy loss which may be too large to be neglected.
The energy equation then becomes:
imlv12

+ 4m2v22 - E

= 4mlV12

+ 4m2V22

where E is the energy loss during impact. I t was pointed out by
Newton that the information in this equation could be stated in a
more useful form by the following method. Consider an impact for
which the changes in velocities are parallel to the x-axis. Write
first the energy and momentum equations for no energy loss:

or :
X l - X2 = -

+ X2)

IMPACT

91

This equation states that the relative rebound velocity after impact
is equal and opposite to the relative velocity of approach. This is
equivalent to stating that there is no energy loss during the impact.
If there is a loss of energy, the two relative velocities will not be
equal, but (A1 - xz) will be smaller than ( X I - x 2 ) . The energy
loss, therefore, can be determined by measuring the relative velocities,
and we may say:

(XI-

X2)

= -

e(i1

-

g2)

where e is a number less than unity. The quantity e, called the
coe8cient of restitution, is thus a measure of the energy loss. When
e = 1, with no energy loss, the impact is said to be perfectly elastic.
If e = 0, the impact is said to be plastic, and the two colliding bodies
remain in contact after impact with zero relative rebound velocity.

As a specific example of the above ideas, consider the problem
shown in Fig. 4.7. The center of gravity of a smooth sphere 1
which has a weight of 2 lb and a radius of 1 in. moves along a straight
line with a velocity of 10 ftlsec. The line along which the center of
gravity moves is tangent to an identical sphere which is a t rest.
The coefficient of restitution for a direct central impact between the
spheres is 0.80. Find the angle between the original and the final
directions of the initially moving sphere.
Taking the coordinate system as in Fig. 4.8, we have:
For conservation of momentum in the x-direction:

Substituting values for V l and V2 from the first two equations into
the third equation, we obtain:
tan 9 =

So, for e = 0.80 we find t h a t :

+ = e - 300 = 50.20

restitution for impact between body A and body B, which weighs 25 Ib, is
0.80. Find the maximum height above its original position attained by

4.5 The Scattering of Particles. Another type of impact
problem which has in recent years become of great importance in
physics may be illustrated by the collision of two charged particles
that exert an inverse square repulsive force upon each other. I n this
problem the nature of the "physical contact" between the two interacting bodies must be studied in considerably more detail than for

the impact problems previously discussed. The interaction of the
particles will be a central force problem, and the results previously
derived for planetary motion may be directly applied.
Consider a light particle of mass rn and electric charge ql which
approaches a heavy particle of mass M and electric charge q 2 , as
shown in Fig. 4.9. The mass m has at a large distance from M a
velocity vo along a line which is at a distance s, the impact parameter,
from the heavy particle. I t will be assumed that M is so large
compared to m that the heavy particle remains at rest during the
interaction. The angle 4 through which the trajectory of m is
deflected is to be determined.
The electrostatic repulsive force between the two charged particles
is a radial force of magnitude:

96

APPLICATIONS O F PARTICLE DYNAMICS

The problem is thus the same as that discussed in the section in
planetary motion, except for the sign of the force, and the results
obtained in that section and in Probls. 4.19 and 4.20 can be applied.
The orbit under the action of a central inverse square force is a conic
which for the repulsion force of the present problem can be described
by the equation:
Y

- e cos I3

thus :

- e cos ;( - $) = 0

T h e sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the system is a
constant E, as in Problem 4.19. Using KO instead of mK as in
Problem 4.20, we have:

Since the force is radial, r28 = constant = k and, following the
method outlined in Prob. 4.19, the eccentricity of the hyperbola can
be written as:
2Emk2
e 2 = 1 +K2
For this particular problem, the constant k = r28 can be evaluated
in terms of the known velocity vo a t large r , which from Kepler's
second law is :
From the conditions a t large r it is seen that E = irnvo2, so that the
expression for eccentricity may be written:

THE SCATTERING O F PARTICLES

97

Substituting this into the above relationship between the deflection
angle and the eccentricity, we finally obtain :

+

This equation gives the scattering angle in terms of the initial
conditions of the problem.
The impact parameter s is not a quantity that can be directly
determined experimentally, whereas the scattering angle 4 can be
directly observed. I t is therefore desirable to put the above relation-

ship in such a form that s does not appear. Suppose, for example,
that a large number of light particles forming a parallel beam
approach a heavy target particle as in Fig. 4.10. Fig. 4.10 (a) shows
a detailed view of the process, while the reduced scale in Fig. 4.10 (b)
indicates that the size of the region in which scattering occurs is so
small that those light particles close to M can be considered to be
scattered to the surface of a sphere of radius R with M as a center.
This supposes that R is large compared to the impact parameter s .
Referring now to Fig. 4.10 (a) it will be seen that all of the particles
which pass through the annular area of radius s to s + ds are deflected
through angles of 4 to 4 + d4. If the number of particles passing
through a unit area of the beam in a unit time is N , then the number
passing through the annular area in unit time is
d N = N e2nsds

98

APPLICATIONS O F PARTICLE DYNAMICS

and this is also the number of particles per unit time that are deflected
through the angles 4 to 4 -I- dd.
From the equation derived above relating s and 4 we obtain:

and fience we can write:

This is the famous Rutherford scattering formula, which puts the
parameters of the problem in such a form that experimental verification of system behavior may be made.
4.6 The Pressure in a Gas. As another illustration of an impact problem we shall consider a simple example from the kinetic
theory of gases. A gas a t low density may be considered as a system
containing a very large number of particles, each one of which is so
far from its neighbors that it is not influenced by them. The
behavior of such gases thus becomes a problem in particle dynamics.

THE PRESSURE I N A GAS

99

Consider a rectangular box of volume V containing N molecules of
a gas. Each molecule has certain velocity components v,, v,, v,, as
shown in Fig. 4.1 1. We suppose that the gas has reached a steadystate condition, that is, the center of mass of the system of molecules
is at rest, and the average density is the same throughout the
volume. Considering now the x-components of velocity, we shall
distinguish between the molecules which travel in the positive
x-direction and those which travel in the negative x-direction. On
the average A7/2 of the molecules will have the positive direction
and N / 2 will have the negative direction. We also note that the
total momentum of the molecules moving in the ( + x) direction

must equal the total momentum of those moving in the ( - x)
direction, since the mass center of the system is at rest.
We now examine the molecules which have velocities in the
( + x) direction. Such particles will eventually collide with the
end of the box and, after the impact, will rebound with reversed
velocities. Let us first consider all the molecules in the box which
have a specific velocity vt in the ( + x ) direction. If there is a
total of ng of such molecules in the box, then on the average during a
time At the number of molecules colliding with the end wall will be

which are further from the wall than vtAt will not reach the wall in
the time At. The total number reaching the wall is therefore nr

100

APPLICATIONS OF PARTICLE DYNAMICS

multiplied by the ratio of the volume vtAtA to the total volume V.
As each particle collides with the wall and rebounds, the velocity of
the molecule is reversed, and the change in momentum, assuming no
energy loss during impact, is ( - 2mvr) per molecule, where m is the
mass of the molecule. The total change in momentum during the
time At is:
2m
nrvt AtA
- 2m vt = - -ntvt2AAt

V

v

From the fact that the total impulse equals the total change in
momentum, we have :

If we let pi be the average force per unit area or pressure exerted by
the molecules against the end wall, we have :

A similar expression will be obtained for the molecules which have a
different velocity, say v,; summing up the pi over all the different
velocities, we obtain:

where Cpt = p

the total pressure on the end of the box, and

We may therefore write:

We now note that the kinetic energy due to the
of velocity is equal to:

components

and that the kinetic energy of translation of all the components of
velocity ( + v,, & v,, & v,) is equal to:

write the above expression for pV as:

where E is the total kinetic energy of translation of the molecules.
I t will be noted that this expression is just a statement of Boyle's
law, which states that the product of the pressure and volume of a
gas is constant at a constant temperature. From thermodynamics
we know that the gas law for varying temperatures is:
pV = RT
where V is the volume of one mole of gas, T is the absolute temperature, and R is the universal gas constant.* We thus obtain the
following relation between temperature and the kinetic energy of a
gas :
i E = RT

* R = Y ,314 x 107 ergs per degree Centigrade per mole of gas. One mole
is that volume which has a mass in grams equal to the molecular weight of the
gas, and which contains 6.02 x 1023 molecules (Avogadro's Number).
where k = Boltzmann'sConstant.

102

APPLICATIONS O F PARTICLE DYNAMICS

For example, at a temperature of 100°C or 373" abs, the kinetic
energy of one mole of gas is:

E = ($)(8.314)(107)(373)= 4.65 x 1010 ergs

= 5.4 x 104 cmlsec = 1770 ftlsec

The root-mean-square velocity is somewhat larger than the mean
velocity.
I n the preceding derivation of Boyle's law it was assumed that the
gas molecules traveled from wall to wall without mutual interference.
This assumption seems reasonable for a gas with small density, but
for a gas of high density it would be expected that there would be
many collisions between molecules. The impacts against the walls
would then be different, and if this is taken into account certain
correction terms must be included in Boyle's law. Experimental
evidence confirms the fact that Boyle's law is not satisfactory for
high gas densities. Another factor must be considered if the gas
consists of complex molecules. If, for example, each molecule is
formed of several atoms, the molecule can have an appreciable
kinetic energy of rotation, which must be included in the analysis.
A more complete analysis of the problem, as developed in the kinetic
theory of gases, shows that in the steady-state condition the total
kinetic energy is divided equally among the degrees of freedom. If
the molecule has the form of a rigid multi-atom body it has six degrees
of freedom-three in translation and three in rotation. In a steady
state 4 of the total kinetic energy would be associated with each
degree of freedom.

4.37. Determine the vertical distribution of pressure in an isothermal
atmosphere. This is the problem of finding the pressure distribution in a
vertical column of gas under the action of gravity. It is assumed that the
temperature is constant throughout the column, and that the pressure and
density are related by the perfect gas law. If M is the mass of one mole
of gas and V is its volume, show that the pressure @ at any height h is:

where 90is the pressure at the base of the column.
4.38. Differences in altitude can be computed from measurements of
barometric pressure if it is assumed that the atmosphere is a perfect gas
of uniform temperature. Using the results of Prob. 4.37, calculate the
difference in altitude corresponding to a change of barometric pressure
from 28 to 26 in, of mercury.

4.7 Variable Mass Systems. There are two types of variable
mass problems which should be carefully distinguished. I n the
first type, the variable mass is a consequence of the particular way
in which the system is defined. If, for example, we take as a system
a rocket, excluding the exhaust gases, then the mass of the system
changes because material is being expelled from the system. The
individual particles of the rocket and exhaust gases themselves are
of constant mass, but the number of particles being considered changes
with time. For such problems the motion of each particle is
described by the equation Fr

=

d

- (mtvt)
at

=

mtat, but the total mass

n

mi is changing because the number of particles

of the system M =
i=

n being considered is changing.
The second type of variable mass problem involves an actual
variation in the mass of the individual particle. This is the situation
encountered in the relativistic variation of mass with velocity, which
will be considered in more detail in later sections of this chapter.
I n this case, the motion of the particle is described b y the equation:

4.8 Jet Propulsion Problems. As an example of a system
whose total mass is changing because material is being ejected we
shall consider a simple problem of jet propulsion. I n Chapter 8 a

more general treatment will be given, and new forms of Newton's
Laws will be derived that will be particularly appropriate for such
problems.
Consider a rocket with velocity v and mass M = Mo - pt, where
p is the rate a t which mass is ejected and M o is the initial mass of
the rocket. The exhaust gases have a velocity v, relative to the
rocket. We wish to derive the equation of motion for the rocket,
neglecting gravity and air resistance. There are two methods of
approach that may be used.
Method 1. We consider as the system to which we shall first
apply Newton's Law the mass (Am) that is exhausted with relative
velocity v, from the rocket in a time At, which is shown within the

dashed area of Fig. 4.13. Writing the equation of impulse-momentum for this element, we have:
FAt = Amv,

As At -t 0, we may say that the force I; on the ejected material is
given by :
dm
I;=-&vs

This force is equal in magnitude to the propulsive force acting on the
.rocket. Considering now the rocket itself, we may write the
equation of motion:
dm
dv
dl vC = AI dt
The rate a t which the total amount of ejected material gains mass is
equal in magnitude to the rate a t which the rocket loses mass, that is:
d-m- - -d M

The final equation

Method 2. I n this method the system under consideration will
include the rocket and the ejected mass, as shown in the dashed
area of Fig. 4.14.
Let
# t = total momentum of the system just before the ejection
of Am, when the rocket has a velocity v .
= total momentum of the system a time At after ejection
of Am.
Since there are no external forces acting on the system, the total
impulse is zero and there is no change in momentum, so $t = $t+at.
The momenta are given by

Dividing by At, and taking the limit as At -+ 0:

as in Method 1 above.
Other examples of variable mass problems of the same type are
given in Section 3.2, Example 2; and Probls. 3.46 and 4.43.

4.9 Electron Dynamics. For our present purpose, the electron
may be considered to be a particle having a mass mo = 9.1 x
grams and carrying a negative electric charge e = -4.80 x 10-10
electrostatic units. If the electron is subjected to a known force, its
motion can be computed from Newton's law written in the form
d
F = - (mu). The equation of motion is written in this form since
dt
it has been observed that when an electron is accelerated to a high
velocity the apparent mass of the electron increases according to
where c is the velocity of light
the equation m = mold1 - ~21~2,
in vacuum (299,800 kmlsec) and mo is the mass of the electron when
v = 0, the rest mass. Since v must exceed 40,000 km/sec for the
Photographic plate

/

mass to be increased by 1%, it is only for very high velocities that
the effect becomes appreciable.
As a first example of a problem in electron dynamics we shall
consider a simplified version of one of the basic experiments which
first permitted a direct experimental verification of the variation of
mass with velocity. That the apparent mass of a charged particle
should increase with speed had been shown from theoretical considerations by J. J. Thomson in 1881, and a direct experimental
confirmation was obtained in 1901 by Kaufmann. In 1909 experiments of Bucherer made possible the accurate determination of the
relation between mass and velocity. The experimental method used
by Bucherer is shown, in a simplified way, in Fig. 4.15. Electrons
are emitted, with all directions and speeds, from a radioactive

108

APPLICATIONS O F PARTICLE DYNAMICS

source R, located between two plates. Only those electrons having
velocities along the axis of the apparatus are used in this experiment.
An electric field E, directed downward, is maintained between the
plates, and the whole apparatus is placed in a magnetic field H
directed perpendicularly out of the paper. While the electron is
between the two plates, it is subjected to a vertical upward force of
magnitude (Ee) due to the electric field. The force acting on an
electron moving with a velocity v in a magnetic field H is ev x H.
In the present experiment v is perpendicular to H, so that a vertical
downward force of magnitude (evH) acts on the electron. If the
forces due to the electric and magnetic field are just equal in magnitude, the resultant vertical force on the electron will be zero, and the
electron will move horizontally with a velocity given by:

The apparatus is arranged with a small hole at A , so that only
electrons which have this horizontal velocity v can emerge from the
box. We thus have a method of producing specified electron velocities.
After leaving the electric field E, in the region between the two
plates, the electron is subjected only to the force of the magnetic
field. Since the force on the electron and hence the acceleration of
the electron are always perpendicular to the velocity, the magnitude
of the velocity does not change but the electron moves in a circular
path of radius r, where:

from which

From this equation an experimental value of

( ) for various

velocities can be determined by measuring the radius of curvature r
of the electron path. As far as this experiment is concerned, the
change in

(i) with velocity could be attributed to changes in either

the charge or the mass, or both, with velocity.

On various theoretical

THE ACCELERATION O F ELECTRONS

109

grounds, however, it is supposed that it is the mass that varies and
not the charge, and this supposition leads to a consistent theoretical
and experimental picture. Both the Lorentz theory of electromagnetic mass and the theory of relativity predicted that the variation
mo
of mass with velocity should be of the form m =
and
dl - v2/c2
hence, according to these theories, the results of the above experiments should be

If this expression is confirmed by the experiment, the same value of

(k)

should be computed from the experimental measurements for

different values of v.
Some typical results of Bucherer's experiments are given in the
following table.*

Since these values of

(k)

are constant within the limits of experi-

mental error, it appears that the experimental results are in good
agreement with the expression for the variation in mass, which is
derived on the basis of the special theory of relativity.
4.10 The Acceleration of Electrons. A number of frequently
used instruments employ a stream of high-speed electrons, so that the
problem of producing high-velocity electrons is of practical importance. Consider the apparatus shown schematically in Fig. 4.16.
A potential difference AV is maintained between a cathode C and
a plate anode A . By definition, the electric field E at a point is the

force on a unit charge at the point, and the potential function V is
related to the electric field E as follows:

Any free electron of charge e in the field will thus be accelerated
toward A by a force whose components are:

If the cathode C is heated, as for example, by a resistance filament,
electrons will be "boiled" off and will then be accelerated by the
electric field. If a plate P with a small opening is placed in front of
the cathode as shown in the diagram, only those electrons traveling
along the x-axis will be free to move to the anode. Such electrons
will move toward the anode under the action of a force F,. If
now a hole is arranged in the anode at the x-axis, the electrons can
pass out of the electric field and continue on with the constant
velocity v which they had attained at the anode. Knowing the
potential difference between the cathode and the anode, the velocity
may be computed by using the principle of work and energy, where

THE CATHODE-RAY OSCILLOSCOPE

the work can be obtained by integration of the above expression for
Fz:
~ ( VA Vc) = &mu2
hence :

We can compute the velocity for a potential difference of
1
1 volt = -esu for the electron as follows:
300

This velocity is of the order of 133,000 mph, which is sufficiently
small compared to the velocity of light so that the variability of mass
with velocity does not need to be taken into account. It is relatively
easy, however, to accelerate electrons to high velocities because the
mass of the electron is small compared to its charge.
4.11 The Cathode-Ray Oscilloscope. An electronic device
which has wide application is the cathode-ray oscilloscope, represented in simplified form in Fig. 4.17. By an arrangement of cathode

and anode as previously described, electrons are accelerated to a
suitable velocity and are focused into a narrow beam through A
along the x-axis. Two plates are arranged parallel to the x-axis so
that an electric field E can be established over a length I of the beam.

112

APPLICATIONS O F PARTICLE DYNAMICS

The whole apparatus is enclosed in an evacuated glass tube. If the
electric field E is zero, the electron stream continues along the
x-axis and impinges against the end of the tube at a, where a bright
spot is formed on the fluorescent screen. If an electric field is set up,
the electrons, as they pass between the plates, will be subjected to a
force which will deflect the beam and so change the position of the
bright spot on the screen.
An enlarged view of the two plates with a single electron between
them is shown in Fig. 4.18. As a simplifying assumption, we suppose
that E is zero outside the plates and uniform between the plates.

Then an upward force of (eE) is exerted on the electron and the
equations of motion are :
mi = 0
my = eE
subject to the conditions that xo = yo = jo = 0 and i O
= v when
t = 0. After the electron has passed through the parallel plates,
an integration of these equations shows that the velocity components
are :
,f=a

As the electron leaves the plates, its path makes an angle 0 with the
x-axis, where :

The effect of the two plates, therefore, is to deflect an electron beam
through an angle 8. After the beam leaves the plates, no force is
exerted on the electrons, and the beam continues in a straight line
a t the angle 9. The luminous spot will thus be deflected from its
zero position a distance y, where:

The displacement of the luminous spot is thus directly proportional
to E and can be taken as a measure of the potential difference between
the plates.
If a second pair of deflecting plates, oriented at 90' to the first
pair, is added to the cathode-ray tube of Fig. 4.17, the luminous
spot will be deflected in the z-direction with a displacement:

z

where E, is the electric field set up between the second pair of plates.
The motion of the luminous spot on the face of the tube is thus given
by the two equations:

is known, E , can be determined from the picture on the tube. The
oscilloscope can thus be used to measure any quantity which can be
converted into a potential difference.

The impulse-momentum equation will be derived first. For the
particular conditions specified above, we have:

Solving for v in terms of the impulse I

I t is seen that as I -t co, v + c, so that no matter how large the
impulse, the velocity can never exceed the velocity of light.
The equation of work and energy is obtained in the usual way
except that m is now a variable:

Integrating by parts the right side of this expression, and writing
Ew for the work done by F , we obtain :

Substituting the expression for m:

Evaluating the integral, this becomes:

THE EQUIVALENCE O F MASS AND ENERGY

115

which is the relativistic expression for the kinetic energy of the
particle. This expression can also be written in the form:

Since mo and c are constants, it appears from this equation that an
increase in the work done on the particle requires a corresponding
increase in the mass of the particle. This unexpected result gave
rise to much speculation regarding our fundamental concepts of
mass and energy. The Theory of Relativity, which Einstein postulated in 1905, states that what we measure as mass is equivalent to
energy, and that the term moc2 represents the energy equivalent of
the particle when it is at rest. If we write E , +moc2 = mc2 and
call E , -I-moc2 the total energy E, we have:

This is the famous expression for the equivalence of mass and energy.
To obtain an idea of the magnitudes involved, we shall compute the
rest energy equivalent of a mass weighing one pound.

E

=

3.0 x 1016 ft-lb

This is roughly equivalent to the energy which would be obtained
from the combustion of 1,500,000 tons of coal or 300,000,000 gallons
of gasoline.
The first approximate experimental verification of the equivalence
of mass and energy was obtained in 1932 by J. D. Cockroft and E. T.
Walton by particle bombardment of lithium. The fact that large
quantities of energy can be released by nuclear fission was demonstrated by the atomic bomb in 1945. Measurements have shown that
the difference in mass between the fission products and the original
nucleus is just equivalent to the energy released.

4.44. An electron is accelerated from rest through a potential drop of
100,000 volts. Compute its velocity assuming that its mass remains
constant, and compare with the velocity obtained when the variability
of mass with velocity is taken into account. This potential drop is small
compared with the several million volts used in modern particle
accelerators.
4.45. The basic elements of a cyclotron are shown in the accompanying
diagram. The device consists of two halves of a cylindrical box, placed
in a uniform magnetic field H as shown. If a particle having a charge e
and a velocity v in the plane of the box is introduced into the box, it is
subjected to the force of the magnetic field which
is given by F = ev x H. The two halves of the
box are maintained at a potential difference AV,
so that as the particle travels from one half to
the other it experiences a velocity change corresponding to AV. By means of an oscillator this
potential is varied periodically in such a way
that the particle always experiences a potential
drop. Show that the particle will move in a
circular path whose radius increases with v , and
that the time required for one-half a revolution
is independent of v . In this way the particle can
be accelerated to a high velocity and can then
be drawn off and used as a bombarding particle.
The foregoing analysis is based on constant
mass. If the velocity is so high that the variability of mass mustbe considered, the time of
revolution is not independent of v and difficulties are encountered in synchronizing the potential drop h V .

following relation, where the single neutron on the left side initiates the
fission which results in the formation of two neutrons:
The mass of the 235 atom is 235.124 amu (amu = atomic mass unit =
1.660 x 10-24 grams) and the mass of the neutron is 1.00897 arnu. The
masses of the X and Y atoms are determined experimentally to be
94.945 amu and 138.955 amu. Calculate the amount of energy in footpounds released per fission.

DYNAMICS OF VIBRATING SYSTEMS

First of all one must observe that each pendulum has its own time of
vibration, so definite and determinate that it is not possible to make it move
with any other period than that which nature has given it. On the other
hand one can confer motion upon even a heavy pendulum which is a t rest by
simply blowing against it. By repeating these blasts with a frequency which
is the same as that of the pendulum one can impart considerable motion.G. Galilei, Discorsi a Due Nuove Scienze (1638).

The analysis of mechanical vibrations is a problem in dynamics
which is often encountered by the engineer. Such problems arise
in connection with the design of almost every type of machine or
structure. The vibration of high-speed machinery, aircraft flutter,
the vibration of buildings during earthquakes, and the design of
dynamic measuring instruments are current problems which indicate
the wide scope of the subject. The same mathematical theory which
is used for the study of mechanical vibrations is also applicable to
certain problems of oscillations in electrical circuits. The similarity
between the basic equations of mechanical and electrical systems has
led to several useful methods whereby the results of analysis or
experimental investigations in one field have been applied to the
other.
I n the present chapter we shall consider only the motion of systems
having one degree of freedom. Such problems are excellent examples
of the methods of particle dynamics and also indicate the theory
behind a large number of interesting technical applications.
5.1 The Vibration Problem. We shall first investigate the
simplest possible mechanical system which contains all the significant
118

THE VIBRATION PROBLEM

'

119

features of a vibration problem. Consider a mass m which has one
degree of freedom, that is, its location at any time is specified by
the one coordinate x. The mass is restrained by a spring k, and an
external force F ( t ) , whose magnitude varies with time, is applied to
the mass, as shown in Fig. 5.1 (a). Fig. 5.1 (b) shows a free-body
diagram of the mass, when it has a positive velocity and displacement
as measured from the position of static equilibrium (x = 0). The
fact that a friction force opposes the motion of the mass is indicated
by the force I;d,which is usually some function of the velocity of the
system, depending upon the nature
of the contacting surfaces and the
conditions of lubrication.
The forces acting upon the mass
belong to three general classes.
First there is the exciting force F(t),
which is the externally applied
force that causes the motion of the
system. Second, there is the restoring force F,, which is the force
exerted by the spring on the mass
and which tends to restore the
mass to its original position.
Third, there is a damping force Fa,
which is always in such a direction
that it opposes the motion of the
system, and which is thus responsible for a dissipation of energy.
The equation of motion can be written:
mx = F, + F a + F(t)
(5.1)
Three such forces, along with the equation of motion, characterize
the vibration problem. When an analysis of a physical problem
leads to Equation (5.1), many of the essential features of the motion
can be analyzed as in the following sections.
5.2 The Characteristics of the Forces. From the definition of
the restoring force it is known that its direction is always toward
the equilibrium position of the system. If the restoring force is
produced by a spring as in Fig. 5.1, it is known that:
F, = - kx

120

DYNAMICS O F VIBRATING SYSTEMS

where the point x = 0 is the equilibrium position and k is the spring
constant which indicates the stiffness of the spring. This spring
force is called a linear restoring force because it is a function of x
raised to the first power. In some instances the restoring force is
not linear. To obtain the solution for non-linear restoring forces is
difficult, so that it is customary to linearize the problem, if possible,
by treating only small oscillations. For example, suppose that the
restoring force is given by some function of x which can be expanded
in a power series:
F8

=

- )(x)

=

- (Alx + kz

x2

x3
+ k3 + . . .

If x is small, the first term of this series is large compared to the sum
of the following terms. Thus if the amplitude of the vibration is
always sufficiently small, a satisfactory approximate solution can
be obtained by taking for the restoring force only the first term of the
series :
F, = - k l x
We shall treat only linear restoring forces. In recent years considerable work has been done on the non-linear problem, but as yet no
general solutions of a simple form have been determined.
The most important characteristic of the damping force is that its
direction is always opposed to the direction of the motion. The
work done by the damping force is thus always negative, and energy
is dissipated from the system. In many instances the damping
force is directly proportional to the velocity of the mass, so that:
Damping which can be described by this equation is called viscous
dam+irtg, and c is called the coefficient of viscous damping. Such a
damping force may arise in a number of ways. The frictional force
set up between two lubricated surfaces, under the usual conditions
of velocity and pressure, is approximately proportional to the
velocity, and air resistance at low velocities may also be assumed to
be viscous in nature. Damping forces are often intentionally
introduced into a system, and this is commonly done by means of a
dashpot filled with oil. Such a device can be designed to give
viscous damping. In some problems in which the damping is not
viscous, the concept of viscous damping may still be used, by defining

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FORCES

121

an equivalent viscous friction, for which thecoefficient of viscous friction
is determined so that the total energy dissipated per cycle is the same
as for the actual damping during a steady state of motion. I n the
analysis to follow, we shall always assume viscous damping forces.
Exciting forces may arise in many different ways. They may, for
example, be transient forces such as would be caused by the impact of
some external body, or they may be repetitive forces caused by a
series of such impacts. Reciprocating or rotating machine parts
often produce unbalanced alternating forces that have a sinusoidal
variation. Consider the rotation of an unbalanced disk as shown in
Fig. 5.2. This arrangement represents
a typical vibration isolating mount for
a rotating machine. The disk of mass
m rotates about the center 0 with an
angular velocity w. The center of mass
of the disk is located a t a distance r from
the center of rotation. The rotating
system is mounted on a larger mass
M which can move only in a vertical
direction. M is supported on a spring
having a spring constant k, and a
dashpot having a coefficient of viscous
dampingc connects the mass to the fixed
support. If we assume that the motion
of M is small compared to r, then the motion of m can be taken as
circular, and the acceleration of the center of mass of the disk is ro2.
There is thus a force of magnitude mrw2 acting in a radial direction upon the large mass M. The component of the force in the y
direction, that is, the component of force which causes motion of
the system is mrw2 sin 8. Assuming that the disk rotates with a
constant speed we have for the exciting force:
F(t ) = -mrw2sin wt
Since small amounts of unbalance are inevitably present in any
rotating machine, sinusoidal exciting forces play an important part
in vibration theory.* A more fundamental reason for the importance

* If the motion of M is not small, m performs two-dimensional simple
harmonic motion during a steady state and the resulting exciting force is
again sinusoidal (see Prob. 5.32).

122

DYNAMICS O F VIBRATING SYSTEMS

of the sinusoidal force is the fact that any periodic force can be
represented analytically as a series of sine and cosine terms, by a
Fourier series expansion. Thus, if the behavior of the system is
known for a sinusoidal force, the behavior of the system can be
determined for any periodic force.
5.3 The Differential Equation of the Vibration Problem.
For the basic vibration problem we shall consider a system which
consists of a linear rest~ringforce, a viscous damping force, and a
sinusoidal exciting force :
Fa = - kx
Fd = - cx
F ( t ) = Fo sin wt
Substituting these terms into the equation of motion gives:
mx = -

kx - cx

+ Fo sin wt

We shall write this equation in the standard form:

where :

k

m

= $2

c
and - = 2n
m

The term lz is called the damping factor. A system described by this
equation is said to be a single degree of freedom harmonic oscillator
with viscous damping. In the following sections we shall derive the
solution of the equation, and we shall examine its physical significance.
5.4 Free Vibrations of an Undamped System. Of the three
forces mentioned above, only the restoring force is necessary for the
existence of a vibration problem. I t may be that energy dissipation
is so small that the damping force may be neglected, and the motion
of the system may be started by initial displacements or velocities
rather than by exciting forces. In this section we shall consider
the s o l u t i ~ nof this simplest type of vibration problem as an illustration of method, the nomenclature to be used, and of the physical
interpretation of the results.
Setting the damping force and the exciting force equal to zero, the
differential equation becomes :
x + p2x = 0

FREE VIBRATIONS OF AN UNDAMPED SYSTEM

123

The solution of this equation is:
x = CI sin $1

+ Cz cospl

where C1 and C2 are constants of integration which must be evaluated
from the initial conditions. That this expression is a solution of the
differential equation may be verified by direct substitution.
When t = 0 let the initial displacement be X Q and the initial velocity
xo. From these two initial conditions the constants CI and Cz may
be found, and the solution of the differential equation becomes:

z = 2 sin

P

+ XQ cos pt

We shall investigate the physical significance of this solution for
= A and lo = 0. This means that the mass is moved a distance
A from its position of equilibrium and is then released, a t time
t = 0, with zero initial velocity. The displacement is then given
by :
x = A cos fid

XQ

The motion of the mass as a function of time is shown in Fig. 5.3,
where it is seen that the mass performs oscillations about the position
of equilibrium. Since there is no energy loss in this ideal system, the
oscillation continues indefinitely with the same amplitude A . The
portion of the motion included between two points at which the mass
has the same position, as B and C in Fig. 5.3, is called one cycle of
the vibration. The time required for the completion of one cycle is

124

DYNAMICS OF VIBRATING SYSTEMS

called the period, T, of the vibration. The number of cycles which
occur in one second is called the freqzcency, f, of the vibration. To
find the period, consider two displacements of the mass which are one
cycle apart, as B and C in Fig. 5.3. Then:

A cos pt = A cos p(t

+

7)

The period can also be found by an energy method in the following
way. The potential energy of the system at any position is
V = 4 kx2 and the kinetic energy is 4 mx2. Since the motion is
known to be harmonic, the displacement and velocity can be written:
x = A sin wt

x

=

Aw cos wt

When x = A , the potential energy is equal to QkA2 and the kinetic
energy is zero. When x = 0, the kinetic energy is imA2w2 and
potential energy is zero. Since energy is conserved:

@zA2w2 = 4kA2

This energy method is useful for obtaining approximate frequencies
in more complicated problems when the motion can be assumed to
be approximately harmonic.

vibrating motion is imparted to the air in the neck of the resonator and the
motion is assumed to be confined to the air in the neck, the air in the
spherical portion acting as a spring. The system can thus be considered
as a single degree of freedom system with the mass shown shaded in the

DYNAMICS O F VIBRATING SYSTEMS

In an actual vibration there will
always be some damping present, Let us consider free vibrations
with viscous damping, and compare the solution of this problem
with that of the undamped oscillation. The differential equation
of the free damped vibration is obtained from the general equation
by setting the exciting force equal to zero:
5.5 Damped Vibrations.

The solution of this equation must be a function which has the
property that repeated differentiations do not change its form, since
the function and its first and second derivatives must be added
together to give zero. For such an equation, we take as a trial
solution x = Ce", which, upon substitution into the differential
equation gives :
Ch2eAt + 2CnXeAt + p2Ce" = 0
Cancelling the factor CeAt we have:
This equation has two solutions for A, each of which will make
= Ce" a solution of the differential equation. The general
solution of the equation may thus be written as the sum of the
two:*
x = CleV + C2eAzt.
(5.6)

I t should be noted that the superposition of solutions is valid only for
linear differential equations, that is, equations which are linear in
the dependent variable and its derivatives.
Solving the algebraic equation we obtain the two values:

A1= - n + 1 / 2 = - p
Az = - n - d n 2 - p2
Hence the solution is :

The physical significance of this solution depends upon the relative
magnitudes of n2 and 92, which determine whether the exponents are
real or complex quantities.
Suppose first that 122 > $2 so that the exponent is a real quantity.

* Since the differential equation is of the second order in its derivatives, the
solution with two constants of integration is the complete solution.

DAMPED VIBRATIONS

Physically this means a relatively large damping, since n is a measure
of the damping in the system. The solution is then:
x = C l e - 4 + c2e-aat
(5.7)
where a1 and a2 are real quantities. The motion of the mass, in this
event, is not oscillatory, but is an exponential subsidence. Suppose,
for example, that the motion is started by giving the mass an initial
displacement A and then releasing it from rest. The displacementtime curve is then as shown in Fig. 5.4. Because of the relatively
large damping, the mass released from rest never passes the static

equilibrium position. So much energy is dissipated by the damping
force that there is not sufficient kinetic energy left to carry the mass
past the equilibrium position. Such a system is said to be overdamped.
If the damping is small, so that lzz < p2, then the term (nz. - p z )
is negative, and we can write:

Using the trigonometric relation eie = cos 8 + i sin 8, the displacement may be written:

+

Since the constants C l and C Zare arbitrary and are to be determined
by the initial conditions, we may simplify the expression by introducing new constants, C1' = i(C1 - C2) and Cz' = C1 + C 2 ;
dropping the primes:
x = e-nt[C1 sin

which was previously derived for the undamped free vibrations.
Comparing the two solutions we see that the effect of the damping

oscillator is shown in Fig. 5.5.
As a convenient measure of
the damping we may compute
the ratio of the amplitudes of
successive cycles of the vibration.

The amount of damping is often specified by giving the logarithmic
decrement 6, where:

For systems having small damping, a simple way of determining the
logarithmic decrement from the free vibration curve is as follows:

small, the higher order terms may be dropped, and:

Thus the logarithmic decrement is approximately equal to the

the system when it is in one of its extreme positions with zero velocity
is :

The energy one cycle later is:

If the damping is small the square term can be dropped, and we have:

Thus for small damping the fraction of energy lost per cycle is approximately equal to twice the logarithmic decrement.

5.6 Forced Vibrations.
Vibrations
which are maintained by an exciting force
are said to be forced vibrations. We shall
now develop the complete solution for the
motion of a damped, simple harmonic oscillator acted upon by the sinusoidal exciting
force Fo sin wt. The differential equation
of the motion (Equation 5.2) is:

The solution of this equation may be written as the sum of two
terms:
x =

e - n t [ C ~sin %
-/2

+ Ce cos m

t

] +J(t)

for we have found from the preceding section that the first term,
when substituted into the differential equation, gives zero. Therefore, a function f (t) must be added of such a form that it will yield

sin wt
llz

when substituted in the equation. This second term is

called the particular solution. Since two arbitrary constants
already appear in the first term, no further arbitrary constants need
be included.
The particular solution in the present problem may be found by
taking a trial solution:
x = A sin wt 4- B cos wt

where the values of A and B are to be determined from the condition
that the differential equation must be satisfied. Substituting into
the equation the expressions:

-

11 = Awcoswt

This equation must be identically satisfied, which means that the
coefficient of the sin wt on the left side of the equation must equal
the coefficient of the sin wt term on the right side of the equation,
and the coefficient of the cosine term must equal zero. Hence:

These two algebraic equations determine the proper values of
A and B:

271.

This motion is shown in Fig. 5.6 for P > w. Because of (e-at) the
first term of the expression decreases with time, and after a sufficient
time it can be considered to be damped out, leaving the motion
described by the second term. For this reason the first is called the
transient term, and the second the steady-state term. The character
of the transient term depends upon the initial conditions of the
motion, whereas the steady state vibrations are independent of the
initial conditions and depend only upon the forcing function and the
parameters of the system.
The most important item in forced vibration problems usually is

and remembering

It is customary to express the damping as a fraction of critical
damping, where critical damping n, is defined by n, = p (see Problem
5.19). We write:

I t will be noted that the term

F)

is the deflection which the system

would have under the action of a static load F o ; that is, it is the
deflection of the system under a forcing function with zero frequency.
The expression on the right side of the equation thus represents a
dynamic amplification or magnification factor and gives the ratio
between the dynamic and static deflections. The variation of this
magnification factor with frequency ratio and damping ratio is
shown in Fig. 5.7. The most significant feature of Fig. 5.7 is the
fact that, near the frequency ratio

(3

can become very large if the damping ratio is small. The infinite

since it is impossible to reduce the damping t o zero, and since it
would require an infinite time to reach the infinite amplitude even

As an example, we might note that the damping ratio

0.03 ;thus the resonant amplitude would be approximately 16times the

value of the steady state amplitude of vibration of the system containing

but a more detailed analysis shows that the accuracy is satisfactory for
many engineering applications.

5.7 Vibration Isolation. One of the useful applications of
vibration theory is to the vibration isolation of instruments and
machinery. As a first example, we shall consider the problem of
mounting an instrument so as to minimize the transmission of vibration from
the supporting structure to the instruyosin
ment. In many applications delicate
instruments must be used in structures
m
which have appreciable amplitudes of
vibration. Unless the instrument can
be isolated from its support it may be
impossible to make accurate measureFIG.5.8
ments. Suppose that the support S
in Figure 5.8 has a motion yo sin wt. The mass of the instrument
is m, and it is attached to the support by a spring k. The damping
in the system is represented by a dashpot having a viscous damping constant c. Letting x be the amplitude of motion of the instrument m, we have as the differential equation of motion:

Writing the right side of the equation as:
@ (k sin wt

+ cw cos w t ) = 2
dlr2 + (cw)2 sin (wt - 8)
m

we see that its effect is the same as a sinusoidal exciting force, so that

146

DYNAMICS O F VIBRATING SYSTEMS

this is an equation of the same type as Equation (5.2), and the same
solution can be used. Putting Fo = y o Z / k 2 + ( C W )in
~ Equation
(5.16),we have for the amplitude of the steady-state forced vibration :

Thus the effectiveness of the mounting in reducing the amplitude is
measured by the expression on the right side of Equation (5.18).
The appearance of this function for various values of
is shown in Fig. 5.9, where it will be noted that at any frequency
ratio greater than 1/Z the amplitude of the mass will be less than the
amplitude of the support. The main difference between this
resonance curve and that given in Fig. 5.7 is that for

);(

VIBRATION ISOLATION

147

the damped curves are above the undamped curves. This means
that the presence of damping decreases somewhat the effectiveness of
the mounting. A certain amount of damping, however, is essential
in order to maintain stability under transient conditions and to
prevent excessive amplitudes should the vibration pass through
resonance during the starting or stopping of the motion of the support.
A second type of vibration isolation problem is illustrated in
Fig. 5.10. Suppose that a machine, as a
result of unbalanced rotating masses, exerts
an alternating force of m'rw2 sin wt upon its
foundation where the mass of the rotating
unbalance is m' and the effective radius r. If
the machine is rigidly fastened to the foundation, the force will be transmitted directly to
the foundation and may cause objectionable
vibrations. I t is desirable to isolate the
machine from the foundation in such a way
that the transmitted force will be reduced.
Letting x be the displacement of the total
mass m of the machine, we have, from the:

The amplitude of the resulting transmitted force is:

Since m'ro2 is the amplitude of the force which would be transmitted
if the springs were infinitely rigid, we have as a measure of the
effectiveness of the isolation mounting the expression :

This is called the transmissibility of the system. I t is exactly the
same a s Equation (5.18) obtained for the vibration isolated instrument, and Fig. 5.9 also represents the solution of the present problem.
The frequency ratio and the damping have the same influence on
the transmissibility as they had on the vibration isolation.

150

DYNAMICS OF VIBRATING SYSTEMS

The output of the instrument will depend upon the relative motion
between the mass and the structure, since it is this relative motion
which is detected and amplified by
mechanical, optical, or electrical means.
Taking x as the absolute displacement
of the instrument mass, the output of
the instrument will be proportional to
z = ( x - y ) . The equation of motion
of the instrument mass is:

5.9 Vibrations with Non-periodic Forces. The analysis of the
preceding sections is sufficient to treat vibrations with sinusoidal exciting forces. Since any periodic forcing function can be represented
by a trigonometric series, the analysis can be extended, b y using
the principle of superposition, t o include the solution for a general
periodic forcing function. For non-periodic exciting forces, however,
it is desirable to develop a different method of approach. W e shall
limit the following analysis t o undamped systems, although i t is possible t o extend the same method t o damped systems (see Prob. 5.60).
We shall consider first the motion of a n undamped spring-mass
system to which a single impulse is applied. Referring to Fig. 5.13,
a n impulse (FoAt) will produce a n initial velocity Ro which can be
determined by the equation of impulse and momentum:

is given b y Equation (5.3) :

We have xo

0 if we measure time from the point of

Having found the motion under the action of one impulse, we may
now, by the principle of superposition, find the motion under the
action of any arbitrary forcing function. It is only necessary to let
the arbitrary function be represented by an infinite number of
impulses. Suppose that the curve of Fig. 5.14 represents an exciting
force, which is applied when t = 0, and that it is desired to determine
the displacement a t time T. Consider the force to be divided into a
large number of impulses, of which one, F ( t ) dt, is shown in the
diagram. The displacement x at the time T due to this impulse can

VIBRATIONS WITH NON-PERIODIC FORCES

155

be determined from Equation (5.21). I n Equation (5.21), t represents
the time which elapses between the application of the impulse and
the measurement of the displacement. Thus a t T, which is ( T - t)
after the impulse is applied, we have:

We use the notation dx because this represents only the contribution
of one impulse to the displacement x. To find the total displacement,
the effects of all of the impulses from 0 to T must be added, which
means that the expression for dx must be integrated, giving:

With this equation, the motion can be computed for any undamped
system which has zero initial velocity and displacement. If F ( t )
is given as a graph or as numerical data, instead of in analytical
form, the integration can be carried out by graphical or numerical
methods, and one of the advantages of the equation is its adaptability
to solutions of this type.
A more formal derivation of the equation can be obtained in the
following way. The differential equation of motion for an undamped
system with an exciting force F ( t ) is:

Multiplying through by the integrating factor sinp(T - t ) and
integrating, this becomes :

Because of the analogy between electrical and mechanical problems,
it is often possible to transfer solutions from one field directly to the

often used for experimental solutions. I t is usually much easier to
build an electrical circuit and to make measurements on it than it is
to construct and test the analogous mechanical system. Electrical

can be set up, and in this way complex electrical, mechanical, and
thermal problems have been solved.*

. . . t h e same law takes place in a system consisting of many bodies a s in a
single body. For t h e progressive motion, whether of one single body, or of a
whole system of bodies, is always t o be estimated from the motion of the center
of gravity.-I. Newton, Principia Philosophiae (1686).
In most dynamics problems it is not possible to approximate the
system by a single particle, but it must be treated as a collection of
particles. The system itself may be a solid body, a fluid, or a gas, but
in any event it may be thought of as a collection of particles, each of
which may be treated by the methods of particle dynamics. The
type of interaction between the individual particles will depend upon
the system being investigated, but certain general relations may be
developed which apply no matter what these interactions may be.
In the present chapter these general relations are developed, and in
subsequent chapters the consequences of the special characteristics
of the systems are treated.
6.1 The Equation of Motion for a System of Particles. The
equation of motion for a typical particle of a system is:

The subscript indicates that the equation applies to the i-th particle.
The resultant force acting upon the particle is written as the sum of
an external force F and an internal force f. The external force
originates outside of the system, and represents the action of some
body or agency upon the system. The internal force originates
164

THE MOTION OF THE CENTER OF MASS

165

within the system in the mutual actions and reactions between the
particles. The reason for distinguishing between these two types of
forces is that when the system as a whole is under consideration, the
sum of all the internal forces is equal to zero. This follows from the
fact that internal forces always occur in equal, opposite, and collinear
pairs and will thus cancel.* An equation of motion for the entire
system is obtained by adding the equations for the individual particles
and setting Cffi = 0:
Cmrfi = CFr
Using the notation CFr

=

F,this becomes:

6.2 T h e Motion of the Center of Mass. The center of mass of
a system of particles is defined as a point located by the vector rc
where

We may introduce this quantity into the equation of motion of the
system by writing Equation (6.2) in the form:

Setting C m r equal to M , the total mass of the system of particles,
this becomes :
F = MfC
(6.3)
Thus we may conclude that the motion of the center of mass is the
same as the motion of a particle, having a mass equal to the total
mass of the system, acted upon by the resultant external force.
The motion of the mass center is therefore a problem in particle
dynamics. This is the justification for having treated finite bodies
as particles in the preceding chapters.
The equation of motion of the mass center may be integrated with

* Collinearity of the internal forces is not always to be assumed. For
example, electromagnetic forces between moving particles are not collinear.
I t will be found that collinearity is not required for the linear momentum
relationships, although it is required for the moment of momentum relationships. See ref. 27, p. 9, 136-140.

166 PRINCIPLES OF DYNAMICS FOR SYSTEMS OF PAKTICIXS

respect to time and with respect to displacement, to give the impulsemomentum and the work-energy equations for the motion of the
center of mass. These are:

I t should be noted that these equations give only information as to
the motion of the center of mass of the system. The term M i c has
the magnitude and direction of the total momentum of the system,
but the location of the line of action of the total momentum vector
is not determined by this expression, for it does not necesszrily pass
through the center of mass. The term &Mi,2 does not represent the
total kinetic energy of the system, since the motion of the parts of
the system with respect to the center of mass will contribute
additional kinetic energy.
6.3 The Total Kinetic Energy of a System of Particles. The
total kinetic energy, T, of a system of particles is the sum of the
kinetic energies of the individual particles:

This expression may be put into another form, which is useful for
many problems, by referring the motion of each particle to the center
of mass of the system. As shown in Fig. 6.1, the vector pi represents

TOTAL KINETIC ENERGY O F SYSTEM O F PARTICLES 167

the displacement of the i-th particle with respect to the center of
mass. For each particle, rt = r , + pi, therefore:

and the kinetic energy may be written:

Since pt is measured from the mass-center, we have Cmtpt = 0 and
the secogd term drops out. The first term may be written:

where M is the total mass of the system. Thus the kinetic energy
becomes :
T = $ M i c 2 + X@tPt2
(6.6)

T h e total kinetic energy m a y thus be said to be the s u m of the energy
which would be obtained if all the mass were located at the mass-center
plus the kinetic energy of the system corresponding to the motion relative
to the mass-center.
The work-energy equation for a system of particles may be put
into a convenient form by using the same transformation. The total
work done by all the forces of the system is:

The sum of the internal forces is zero, Z j t = 0; hence the second
term drops out. Equating the total work done to the change in
total kinetic energy, we have:

We have already shown that the first term on the left is equal to
the first term on the right, so that the second term on the left must

equal the second term on the right.
independent equations :

We may thus write the two

T h e first of these equations describes the motion of the center of mass of
the system, while the second describes the motion of the system with
respect to the center of mass. The fact that these two equations can
be written independently of each other simplifies the solution of
problems b y the energy method.

6.11. The system of Prob. 6.8 is initially at rest when an impulse FAt,

find the total energy imparted to the system and describe the subsequent

6.12. A mass m moving with a velocity v in a direction perpendicular to
the bar strikes one of the masses in the system of Prob. 6.8. Describe the
subsequent motion of the mass-center of the bar, and find its angular

impact and assuming no gravitational force acting.

6.4 Moment of Momentum. Consider a particle of mass m and
momentum mi., as shown in Fig. 6.2. The moment of momentum*
of the particle about the fixed point 0 is defined as the moment of the

momentum vector about the point 0. Calling the moment of
momentum vector HI we have :
The total moment of momentum of a system of particles is the sum
of the moments of momentum of all the individual particles:
H = Xrt x mtPi

(6.9)

The concept of the moment of momentum can be used to put the
equation of motion into a new form, which is particularly convenient
for the treatment of systems of particles. To do this, we differentiate
H with respect to time, and find:

* The quantity moment of momentum is also called the angular momentum.
Since no angular motion or rotation need be present in order that the moment
of momentum should exist, the term moment of momentum is preferred.

172 PRINCIPLES OF DYNAMICS FOR SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES

Since t i x

it =

0 the first term drops out, giving:

Taking the cross product of each side of the equation of motion
mii.'r = Ft + fi by rt and summing, we obtain:
The left side of this equation is k and the right side represents the
moment of all the forces about the fixed point 0. Since the internal
forces occur in equal, opposite, and collinear pairs, their moments
cancel and the right side of the equation is just the sum of the
moments of the external forces. Writing this moment sum as M,
we have :
8 = M
(6.10)

k,the time rate

of change of the moment of momentum of the system
about thejxed point 0 , i s equal to M , the resultant moment of the external
forces about the same point 0 . This is called the equation of the
moment of momentum. I t is a restatement of the equation of
motion in a form which, as we shall see in the next chapter, is
particularly convenient for application to problems of rigid body
dynamics.
When there is no external moment acting on the system, the
equation of the moment of momentum takes the form:

k

=

0 or H

=

constant

(6.11)

This is the principle of the conservation of moment of momentum, which
states that, if there is no external moment of force about the fixed
point, the moment of momentum about that point must remain
constant. If there is no moment about the x-axis, H , is conserved
even if H , and Hz are not conserved.
I n the preceding paragraphs the moment of momentum was taken
with respect to an arbitrary, jxed point. I t is often convenient to
choose a point which is not fixed. We shall now show that an
equation of the form of Equation (6.10) will be valid for any point
whose velocity is parallel to the velocity of the center of mass of the
system.
In Fig. 6.3 the point 0 is a fixed point and P is the moving point
about which the moment of momentum equations are to be expressed:

MOMENT OF MOMENTUM

The vector st locates a typical mass mi of the system, and the moment
of momentum of the system about P will be:

Hp

Zsr x mt+g

The time derivative of H, is:

Since st = rt - r,, the second term of this expression becomes:

ZSi x mt+t = Z(it
We may also put

so that this last term becomes:

0, and we

We thus see that if i., x PC = 0, that is if the velocity of the point P
is parallel to the velocity of the center of mass, we obtain:

aP= M,

174 PRINCIPLES O F DYNAMICS FOR SYSTEMS O F PARTICLES

If the point P is the center of mass of the system, then the expression

kc= M c
(6.12)
is always correct.
The equation of moment of momentum i n theform k = M can thus
be referred to a n arbitrary fixed point, to the moving center of mass of
the system, or to any moving point whose velocity is parallel to the velocity
of the center of mass.
The equation of moment of momentum is often written in terms
of rectangular coordinates as :
82 = M z ; 8, = M y ; 8, = Mz
For example, for a single particle acted upon by a force F :

H=rxmv

and M = r x F

Writing r, v, and F i n terms of their rectangular components gives:

H = ( x i + y j + z k ) x m ( x i + yj + i k )
M = ( x i + y j + z k ) x (F,i + F,j + F z k )
Carrying out the multiplications, remembering that i x i
i x j = k , etc., gives:

(6.13)

These equations can also be obtained by taking moments about the
x-, y-, and z-axes respectively. If a system of particles is involved,
these equations can be summed over all the particles.
6.5 Summary. I t should be emphasized that the principles
derived in this chapter are general in application, and that the system
of particles need have no special properties. These principles are
thus available for use in the analysis of rigid and deformable solid

bodies, liquids, and gases. The general conclusions can be summarized in the following statements.

though it were a particle, having a mass equal t o the

of the external forces applied to the system. All the
methods of particle dynamics may thus be applied to
the motion of the mass center.
(2) The magnitude and direction of the total momentum of a

(3) The work-energy principle for a system of particles may
be written in the form of two independent equations.
One equation describes the motion of the center of
mass of the system, and the other equation describes
the motion of the particles of the system with respect
to the center of mass.
(4) The equation of moment of momentum may be written
with respect to: (1) an arbitrary fixed point, (2) the
moving center of mass of the system, or (3) any moving
point whose velocity is parallel to the velocity of the
center of mass.

When applying the principles of dynamics to solid bodies it is
usually assumed that the motion of the body is not influenced by
the small deformations caused by the applied forces. This is equivalent to the assumption of a rigid body, and so far as the motion of the
body is concerned this assumption introduces only negligible errors
for the great majority of such problems encountered in engineering
practice. The equations of motion for a rigid body may be developed
by treating the body as a collection of particles and applying the
general principles of dynamics as formulated in the preceding chapter.
The condition for a rigid body, that the distances between the
particles remain fixed, is then used to simplify the general equations.
As the first step in deriving the required equations of motion, it will
be necessary to investigate the motion of each point in a rigid body.
7.1 Kinematics of Rigid Body Motion. To describe the
motion of a rigid body it is necessary to specify in some way the
motion of every point in the body. This may be done analytically
by applying the general kinematic equations of Chapter 2.
Consider two points A and B fixed in a rigid body, as in Fig. 7.1.
Let the vector r~ describe the position of point A in a fixed (X, Y, 2)
178

KINEMATICS O F RIGID BODY MOTION

coordinate system, and let A be the origin of a moving ( x , y, z ) coordinate system which is attached to the rigid body. From
Chapter 2, the general kinematic equations are (Fig. 2 . 1 2 ) :
i = & + w x p + p ,
i : = # + o x ( w x p ) + 4 ~ p + i j r + 2 ~ ~ @ ~

For the present problem the vector p ~ which
,
locates the point B in
the moving ( x , y, z) system, is a constant, and the above equations
become :
rB = rA
pB
PB = PA + w x p~
(7.1)
= rA + w x ((w X PB) + & X pB
where w is the angular velocity of the body. From these equations
the motion of any point in a rigid body can be determined in terms
of the motion of one point in the body and the angular velocity of the
body. These equations are thus the analytical expression of the fact
that the motion of a rigid body can be described as the sum of a
translation and a rotation.*
Equations ( 7 . 1 ) are often written in the form :

+ VBA
UB = U A + UBA
rg =

VB = VA

where v and a designate velocity and acceleration, and:

as may be seen by comparing Equations (7.2) with Equations (7.1).
The quantity ~ B Ais often referred to as the displacement of the
point B with respect to the point A . Similarly, V B A and ~ B are
A
referred to as the velocity and acceleration of the point B with respect
to the point A . I t should be noted, however, that displacements,
velocities, and accelerations must be defined with respect to coordinate systems, and hence the above phrase "the point B with
respect to the point A " really refers to the motion of B with respect
to a translating coordinate system
whose origin coincides with A . I n
this way, by the use of the general
kinematic relationships, the concept of relative motion can be made

direction different from V A , and neither can it have a direction

The point located by r, has an instantaneous velocity equal to zero.

KINEMATTCS OF RIGID BODY MOTION

This point is called the instantaneous center of rotation. At any
particular instant the velocity of every point in the body is the same
as if the body were rotating about the instantaneous center.

5 ft long and link 4 is 3 f t long. Link 1 has an angular velocity
of 2 revolutions per sec and an
angular acceleration of 3 revolutions per sec2, both clockwise.
Determine the velocities and
accelerations of links 2 and 3.

7.2 The Moment of Momentum of a Rigid Body. For the
analysis of the motion of a rigid body the equation of motion of the
mass center can always be written:

F

=

mr,

This equation describes only the translation of the mass center and

in addition we require equations describing the rotations of the body
These can be derived by applying the equation of moment of
momentum :

M = A
I t has been shown in Chapter 6 that this equation can be written
with respect either to a fixed point, or to the center of mass of the
system. We shall first derive an expression for the moment of
momentum H,of a rigid body about its center of mass.
In Fig. 7.5, 0 is the origin of a fixed (X, Y, 2 ) coordinate system,
and C is the origin of a moving ( x , y, z) coordinate system which is
attached to a rigid body and is located a t the center of mass of the

T H E MOMENT O F MOMENTUM O F A RIGID BODY

187

body. The density of the body is p, dV is a typical volume element
located by the radius vector r , drawn from the center of mass, and
the angular velocity of the body is o. The absolute velocity of the
volume element dV is v . We may then write:
dHc
Hc

=
=

r, x (pdV)v
f p ( r c x v ) dV

12, + o x rc so we obtain:
Hc = J p [ r c x (12, + o x r,)] dV
= Jp(rc x 12,) dV

But also, v

=

In the first term

+ Jp[rc x

( w x rc)] dV

12, is a constant for all elements of the body, so:
Jp(rc x 12,) dV = (Jpr, d V ) x 12,

and this is equal to zero since rc is measured from the center of
mass of the body.
We thus obtain the result:
Hc

=

Jp[rc x ( w x rc)l dV

(7.3)

Having obtained the moment of momentum about the center of
mass, the moment of momentum with respect to any other point
may be derived as follows.
In Fig. 7.6, 0 is the origin of a fixed coordinate system; C is the

T H E DYNAMICS O F RIGID BODIES

188

center of mass of a moving rigid body; A is any point in the body, and
rA is the vector locating the volume element dV with respect to A ,
The absolute velocity of dV is v. We thus have for the moment of
momentum of the rigid body about the point A :

since v

We may then make the substitution rA

we obtain:

Equation (7.4)may be thought of as a general transfer theorem for
the moment of momentum of a rigid body. Note that A in Fig. 7.6
can be any point, fixed in space or moving with the body.
7.3 Moments and Products of Inertia. In the preceding
section it has been shown that the expression for the moment of

CALCULATION O F MOMENTS AND PRODUCTS O F I N E R T I A 189

The rectangular components of the moment of momentum may thus
be written:

Introducing the following notation for the integrals which appear
in these expressions :

Jp(y2 + z2) dV = I,,
Spxy dV = I,,, etc.,
the equations become :

The terms I,,, I,,, and I,, are called the moments of inertia, and
the terms I,,, etc., are called products of inertia. I,, is often written
as I,, etc., and it will be noted from the symmetry of the integrals
that I,, = I,,, etc.
The inertia integrals are defined with respect to the xyz axes. If
the coordinate axes have fixed directions in space, then as the body
rotates the numerical values of the inertia integrals will change with
time. On the other hand, if the coordinate axes are fixed in the
body so that they rotate with it, then the inertia integrals are constants but the components Hz, H,, and Hz are measured along
rotating coordinate axes. Either type of coordinate system may be
used, but in most problems the second type is more convenient. In
the following sections we shall use a coordinate system that is fixed
in the body and rotates with it, unless it is specifically stated to the
contrary.
Before treating the general equations of motion of a rigid body we
shall consider the problem of determining the inertia integrals.
7.4 The Calculation of Moments and Products of Inertia.
Although the computation of moments and products of inertia
requires only the evaluation of simple definite integrals it is found
that unless the body has a very simple shape and orientation the
limits of integration are such as to require an excessive amount of

190

THE DI'NAMTCS OF RIGID BODIES

labor. The problem is very much simplified by the following three
observations :

(1) If the moments and products of inertia are known for a
particular set of axes, they can be found for any parallel
set of axes by a transformation of coordinates.
(2) If the moments and products of inertia are known for a
particular set of axes, they can be found for a rotated
set of axes by a transformation of coordinates.
(3) The moments and products of inertia of a body of complicated shape can be found by subdividing the body
into a number of simpler parts, evaluating the integrals
for each of these, and then summing them.
The method of calculation is thus to subdivide the body into simple
parts, choosing for each part coordinate axes which will make the
integration easy. By transformation of coordinates the moments
and products of inertia with respect to the desired axes can then be
found. I t should be noted that this and the following sections deal
only with methods of calculation which shorten the labor of
evaluating inertia integrals.
Before proceeding with the calculation of inertia integrals, we
introduce some commonly used notation. Consider, in Fig. 7.7, any
rigid body having a mass per unit volume p. Then by definition of
the moments of inertia, we have:

Note that a,, a,, a, are the perpendicular distances from the respective axes to the volume element and are not the components of the
radius vector to the element. These expressions are sometimes
written as I , = mr,2, I , = mr,2, and I , = mr,2, where m is the
total mass of the body, and the quantity r , is called the radius of
gyration of the body about the x-axis, etc. The radius of gyration
is thus given by:

TRANSLATION O F COORDINATE AXES

The product of inertia integrals have the form:

Since x and y can be either positive or negative, the product of inertia
can be either positive or negative. In particular, if the yz plane is
a plane of symmetry for the body, there is a negative pxy dV for
each positive pxy dV and the product of inertia is zero. As will be
shown later, the product of inertia may be zero also when there is no
plane of symmetry in the body.

7.5 Translation of Coordinate Axes. Suppose that the
moments and products of inertia are known with respect to one set
of axes, and we wish to determine the moments and products of
inertia with respect to a parallel set of axes. In Fig. 7.8, the x',
y', z' system has its origin located a t the center of mass of the body.
The moments of inertia with respect to this centroidal system are
I,,, I,,, and I;, and the products of inertia are I;,,, I,*t*,I,,;.
In
the parallel xyz system the center of mass is located a t the point
xc, y,, z,. We have then:

192

THE DYNAMICS O F RIGID BODIES

Since the origin of the x'y'z' system is at the center of mass, the
integrals Spx' dV and Spy' dV are equal to zero; also:
Sp(x1z -k yJ2)dV = It'
(xc2 yc2) = a2cr
J p dV = m

+

so:

IZ= Iz,+ ma2cz

(7.8)

Thus if the moments of inertia are known with respect to centroidal
axes, the moments of inertia with respect to any parallel axes can be
obtained.
The transformation of products of inertia for translation of coordinate axes may be derived in the same way. Referring again to
Fig. 7.8, we have:

and the transformation equation is

+

Is, = Ixtytmxcyc

(7.9)
7.6 Rotation of Coordinate Axes. Suppose that the moments
and products of inertia of a body are known with respect to an x'y'z'
set of axes. Let us determine the moments and products of inertia

193

ROTATION OF COORDINATE AXES

of the body with respect to an xyz set of axes which has been rotated
with respect to the x'y'z' axes. In Fig. 7.9, the two coordinate
systems are shown, and an element of volume dV of the body is
located by the radius vector R. Considering first the transformation
of a typical moment of inertia, we have:

I,, = SPaz2dV
We shall now express the integral in terms of x', y', and z'.
az2 = R2 - ~2 = X'2 + y'2 + ~ ' 2 $2

+ y'j' + z'k'

R = xi

First:

Also :

+ zl(i.k')

We next note that the term (ioi') is equal to the cosine of the angle
between the x-axis and the xl-axis. Denoting the direction cosines
by I , we have :
l Z z=
~ i.i' ;
= join;etc.
so that :
X = xllZZ1+ y1lzy,+ z'l,z1
With this notation the moment of inertia becomes:

Since 12,;

Sp[(x12+ y'2

=

+ PZy1+ 122Ep= 1, we may write:

Multiplying out these expressions, and combining terms gives :

(7.10)

194

THE DYNAMICS OF RIGID BODIES

The products of inertia can be transformed in the same manner,
giving :

The large number of terms and subscripts involved in these expressions makes desirable a systematic method of writing the transformations. Let us arrange the moments and products of inertia in
rows and columns as:

I'

= y'

I

- I,','

+ l y t y t- I y l z ,

Note the similarity between this group of terms and the terms
appearing in Equation (7.6). Such a systematic grouping of rows
and columns is called an array, and the purpose of the array is to
present a large number of terms in an orderly and easily remembered
system. The letters on the outside of the array are usually omitted,
it being understood that the terms are arranged in that order. With
respect to an xyz coordinate system the array is written:

Note that the array is symmetrical about the main diagonal with all
products of inertia terms being negative and all moments of inertia
being positive.
The procedure for expressing any of the moments or products of
inertia of I in terms of the moments and products of inertia I' is as
follows. Let IaB represent any one of the terms in the I array
where both a and fl may assume the values x, y, z, depending upon
the term under consideration. Similarly, let I.#Bt represent any
term in the I' array. The direction cosines which relate the directions

ROTATION O F COORDINATE AXES

195

of the two coordinate systems will be written lape. With this notation
we observe that each term in the preceding transformation has the
form 1a8~1pa11a,p1,
and the transformation between the two coordinate
systems may be written:

To illustrate the meaning of this notation, we shall evaluate the
term I,, which we can then check with the previously determined
expression. We note first that if a # /3, the term I,@
equals - I z y ,
- I y z , etc., whereas, if a = /Ithe term IaB
= + I,,,
+ I y y , etc.
From the preceding equation we have therefore:

Summing first with respect to /3':

Then summing with respect to a' we have the nine terms:

This is the same as Equation (7.11).
With this transformation, the moments and products of inertia of
any rigid body can be computed for any rotated coordinate axes,
once the inertia integrals are known for one set of axes in the body.
The array

where it is understood that the terms are defined as above, is called
the tensor of inertia, and one may speak of transforming a tensor by
means of the tensor transformation:

196

THE DYNAMICS OF RIGID BODIES

In general, if under a transformation of coordinates an expression
transforms according to this equation, it is called a tensor of the
second rank.
The above transformations for the rotated coordinate system can
also be derived in a more compact form by a vector method, as
follows. Let ea and e8 be unit vectors in the a = x, y , z and
fi = x, y , z directions. Then, since r2 = x2 + y2 + 22, and since
e a .e8 = 1 for a = ,El and e a .e8 = 0 for a # ,El, a general expression
defining all of the products and moments of inertia is:

A typical transformation equation such as has been written above in
the form x = Zxxpx'+ lx,y' + lx,,zr becomes in the new notation:

Similarly, the transformation equation for the unit vectors becomes:

Substituting these expressions for a and e, into Equation (7.14) we
obtain :

which becomes :

Note that with the notation of equation (7.14) the signs are automatically included in the expressions in the correct way.
7.7 Principal Axes. In the preceding transformations there
were three products of inertia and three moments of inertia, so that
the transformation formulas involved a correspondingly large
number of terms. If, however, the initial set of axes is chosen in a
special way, there is a substantial reduction in the number of terms.
This is illustrated by the following considerations.
If the unit vectors in the two coordinate systems are i, j , k and

PRINCIPAL AXES

197

i', j', k' respectively, then the direction cosines are given by
I,,' = i.il, etc. Thus:

We have i.i = 1, etc., and i.j = 0, etc.; carrying out these dot
products, using the above expressions for i, j, and k, we obtain the
following six relations between the direction cosines:

Since there are nine direction cosines with these six relations between
them which must always be satisfied, there remain three independent
relations which are required to specify the orientation of the x'y'z'
axes with respect to the xyz axes. We may take as these three
additional relations the conditions that the three products of inertia
with respect to the x'y'z' axes are to be equal to zero. In this way
it is possible to find a coordinate system with respect to which the
three products of inertia disappear, so that the inertia tensor becomes:

The coordinate axes which satisfy this condition are called +rinci+al
axes. It is customary to use principal axes whenever possible
because of the simplifications which they introduce. Since the products of inertia are all zero, the moments and products of inertia
can be transformed to any other set of axes which is rotated with
respect to the principal axes, by the simplified equations:

198

THE DYNAMICS O F RIGID BODIES

where I Z r x , ,I,,,, and Izl,, are the moments of inertia about the
principal axes, the principal moments of inertia.
Let us suppose that for a particular body the principal axes have
been defined so that I,',' > I,*,* > IZaz1.Then the moment of
inertia of the body about some other axis, the x-axis, is:

Using the relation 1,2,1

+ I&# + 1,2;

=

1 , this becomes:

Each of the terms inside of the brackets is positive so that the
maximum value of I,, must occur when
has its largest value of
1, and when 1;; has its smallest value of 0, so that

Thus it is proved that the largest principal moment of inertia is also
the largest moment of inertia that can be obtained by any orientation
of the axes. In the same way it can be shown that the smallest
principal moment of inertia is the smallest moment of inertia which
can be obtained by any orientation of the axes. We thus see that the
principal axes have not only the property that the products of inertia
about these axes vanish, but in addition the principal moments of
inertia correspond to the maximum and minimum moments of
inertia for any orientation of the axes. As has been shown above,
the moment of inertia of a body may be obtained by adding a term
to the moment of inertia about a parallel axis through the center of
mass. Therefore, the minimum principal moment of inertia with
respect to a coordinate system passing through the center of mass of
the body is the minimum moment of inertia for any possible axis.
If a body has two perpendicular planes of symmetry, a set of
principal axes can be determined by inspection, since it is only
necessary to make two of the coordinate planes coincide with the
planes of symmetry in order that the products of inertia become
equal to zero. If the body does not have such planes of symmetry,
the orientation of the principal axes must be determined from the
expressions for the products of inertia, by setting the products of
inertia equal to zero.

The xyz axes are fixed in the body with the origin a t the center of

The appropriate expressions for Hz, Hy and Hz must be substituted

These are called Euler's equations of motion of a rigid body. It should
be noted that in Euler's equations the xyz axes are the principal axes
of the body, with origin a t the center of mass of the body.
An impulse-momentum equation may be obtained t o describe the
rotation of a rigid body by a direct integration of M = fi with
respect to time:

204

THE DYNAMICS OF RIGID BODIES

This equation states that the moment of impulse is equal to the
change in the moment of momentum.
To obtain the work-energy equation for the rigid body we shall
first derive a general expression for the total kinetic energy of a rigid
body. Referring to Fig. 7.5, the kinetic energy of the element dV
is 1/2(pdV)v2, and hence for the whole body:

T = &Jp(v*V ) dV
For a rigid body, v
becomes :

=

vc + o x rc, SO that the expression for T

The first term in this expression can be written as:
The second term becomes:
Sp[vc.(w x rc)] dV

=

v , ~ ( wx Spr, dV)

=

0

since rc is measured from the center of mass. By an interchange of
the dot and the cross vector multiplication the third term becomes:
gSp[(o x r c ) - ( ax r,)] dV = &w-Sp[rcx (w x r,)] dV = +aHc
Thus the complete expression for the total kinetic energy of the rigid
body becomes :

T

=

&mvc2+ & w *Hc

(7.19)

where m is the total mass of the body, vc is the velocity of the center
of the mass, and H, is the moment of momentum of the body with
respect t o the center of mass. The first term represents the kinetic
energy of translation, and corresponds to the first term of the general
Equation (6.6). The second term represents the kinetic energy of
rotation about the mass center, and corresponds to the second term
of the general Equation (6.6).
Expanding the dot product, the kinetic energy of rotation can be
written as:

where the moments and products of inertia are defined with respect

GENERAL EQUATIONS O F MOTION FOR A RIGID BODY 205

to a coordinate system whose origin is at the center of mass of the
body.
The forces acting on the body are equivalent to a resultant force
F acting at the center of mass, plus a resultant moment Mc about
the center of mass. The rate at which work is done is
The work done is the integral of this with respect to time and thus:

For a rigid body this equation takes the place of Equation (6.8)and
can be used to supplement Equation (6.5),which describes the work
energy principle as applied to the motion of the center of mass of
any system under the action of external forces.
EXAMPLE
1 . The center of mass of a rigid body of mass 50 lb
secZ/ft has a velocity of magnitude 40 ft/sec. At a given instant the
moment of momentum of the body about the center of mass is
Hc = 1500i + lOOOj + 1200k lb ft sec. The inertia integrals about
the same coordinate axes are:

Find the angular velocity and the kinetic energy of the body a t the

2. In Fig. 7.10, 0.4 B and OA D represent two identical
right circular cones of mass M, altitude h and half angle a. The
vertical cone OAD is fixed, and OAB rolls around the vertical cone

the fixed vertical axis O F with an angular velocity wo. Find the
moment of momentum of the moving cone about the vertex 0, and
find the total kinetic energy of the moving cone.
Solution. Take x , y, z as principal axes with the origin at the center
of mass of the moving cone as in Fig. 7.11. Let C! be the angular
velocity of rolling of the moving cone about the common element

7.9 Equations of Motion f o r a Translating Body. The
simplest type of rigid body motion is that of translation. A body
having translatory motion moves in such a way that any line in the
body always remains parallel to its original position, that is, the

208

THE DYNAMICS OF RIGID BODIES

angular velocity of the body is always zero. The moment of
momentum equation written about the mass center is :

Mc

=

fiC

and since the angular velocity is zeio, Ac = 0, and therefore:
Mc

=

0

The equation of motion of the mass center is:

F

=

mr,

Writing these equations in rectangular coordinates, where XC,ye, zc
are the coordinates of the center of mass, we obtain:

The force equations describe the motion of the mass center and the
moment equations describe the reactive forces which prevent rotation
of the body.
EXAMPLE.
A body of total mass m moves along a horizontal
plane under the action of a force F as shown in Fig. 7.12. The
coefficient of kinetic friction between the body and the surface is p.
Find the acceleration of the body as a function of the force F, and
determine the reactions exerted by the surface on the body at A
and B.
Solution. We choose the x-axis in the direction of the motion of
the body. The complete free-body diagram is then drawn. The

7.10 The Rotation of a Rigid Body about a Fixed Axis.
Take the z-axis as the axis of rotation, and let the x and y axes be
attached to the body and rotate
with it as in Fig. 7.14. Since the
origin of this coordinate system is
fixed in space, we may write the
equation :

M = 8
taking the origin as the moment
center. In Equations (7.6) for the
components of H we may put
w x = w y = 0, since the rotation is
about the z-axis, and hence Equations (7.16) become :

Performing the differentiations, the three moment equations become:

ROTATION OF A RIGID BODY ABOUT A FIXED AXIS

213

In addition, the equations for the motion of the center of mass are
available :
FZ= mxo
F, = my,
FZ= 0
The rotation of the body about the fixed axis is described by the
third moment equation, while the constraining forces which hold the
axis stationary may be found from the first two moment equations
and the equations of motion of the mass center.
The impulse-momentum equation and the work-energy equation
for a rotating body may be derived directly from the third moment
equation, M , = I,&,:

The integral of M, dt is the angular impulse or moment of impulse
about the axis of rotation, and the term I,w, is the moment of
momentum about the axis of rotation, as may be checked from the
general Equation (7.6). Similarly, for the energy equation:

The integral of M, d0 represents the
work done by M, during the rotation, and the term (1/2)IZw,2is the
kinetic energy of rotation. This may
be checked from the general energy
Equation (7.19) since Tmt = 4 o
wH
where H = IZwZk, and therefore
Trot =

The number of revolutions occurring in time t can be found from the
work-energy relation of Equation (7.25) :

2. A homogeneous
disk of radius R and of uniform
thickness is supported by a thin

The rod is rigidly attached to the

position through an angle 19, the
rod exerts a restoring torque on

action of a torque -kt?, where k is the torsional spring constant in

the axis of the rod:

a torsion pendulum. Torsional oscillation problems are in every way
similar to the linear oscillation problems treated in the chapter on
vibrations and the same methods may be used. Many practical
examples of such problems in engineering can be found, such as the
torsional oscillations of engine crankshafts and of propeller shafts.
EXAMPLE
3. Investigate the dynamic bearing reactions caused
by the rotation of an unbalanced rotor.
Solution. Consider a rotor of total weight W supported horizontally on two bearings a distance 1 apart as shown in Fig. 7.17.

216

THE DYNAMICS OF RIGID BODIES

The z-axis is taken as the fixed axis of rotation, and the xy axes are
attached to the rotating body. During the rotation there will be
dynamic reactions at the supports of the rotor. We shall determine
these dynamic reactions XI, Y1, X2, Y2 in the rotating xyz system
and it is to be understood that, if the total bearing reactions at any
instant are required, the dynamic reactions, located in the correct
direction at that instant, must be added to the static reactions
caused by the weight of the rotor. The equations of motion of the
mass center give us directly:
C.Fx = mx,; X I + X 2 = - mxcw2 - my,
XF, = mji,; Y1 Y2 = mxC&- mycw2
The moment of momentum equations give:

+

&

Knowing m, w , &, x,, y,, Is,and I,,, we can find the four unknown
dynamic reaction components from these four equations.
If the products of inertia are zero, and if the center of mass lies
on the axis of rotation so that x, = y, = 0, then it will be seen that
there are no dynamic reactions.
he rotating body is then said to
be dynamically balanced. If the center of mass lies on the axis of
rotation so that the system is statically balanced, there is no gravity
torque for any position of the body, but there may still be some
dynamic unbalance because of the presence of product of inertia
terms. Since for static balance the mass center has zero acceleration:

The dynamic reactions hence exert a couple on the rotor.
I t is thus seen that static balancing of a rotor is not in general
sufficient to remove the dynamic reactions, since a rotating dynamic
couple may still be present. Complete dynamic balance is achieved
by adding to the system two balance weights, so located that the
dynamic reactions set up by the balance weights are equal and
opposite to the dynamic reactions resulting from the original
unbalanced rotor. This is equivalent to making the products of
inertia of the rotating system zero, by the addition of the extra
balancing weights.

THE DYNAMICS OF RIGID BODIES

Let the xyz coordinate axes be fixed in the body with the origin at
the center of mass. The general equation of motion Me = Bc then
has the components:
M1: = IyZwz2 - IzzLi)Z
M y = -IzzwZ2 - l y z &
(7.26)
M z = IZGt
I n addition there are the independent equations for the motion of the
mass center:
F z = mx,
F , = my,
Fz = 0
I t will be noted that these six equations are identical with those

obtained for the rotation of a body about a fixed axis. The origin
of the coordinate system, however, is located at the center of mass
for plane motion, whereas for rotation it is located on the fixed axis
of rotation.
EXAMPLE
1 . A circular cylinder of radius R and mass m is
pushed along a horizontal plane by a horizontal force F at a distance
h above the plane, as shown in Fig, 7.18. The coefficient of kinetic
friction between the cylinder and the surface is p. Describe the
motion of the cylinder.
Solution. A free-body diagram of the cylinder is first drawn, as
shown in Fig. 7.19. The coordinate x, describes the linear position
of the center of the cylinder, measured from a fixed point, and the

coordinate B describes the angular
position. For the motion of the
center of mass in the x-direction, we have the equation:
Taking moments about the z-axis, which passes through the center
of mass, we obtain :
This gives two equations relating the three unknowns xc, 8, and f.
The additional equation to be used will depend upon whether or not
there is slipping between the cylinder and the plane. If there is no
slipping, we may write RB' = -Xc, which, together with the first two
equations, gives :
FhR

If the value of the friction force f computed in this way exceeds the
value pW, then slipping will occur, and RB' # Xc. Then the third
equation to be used is f = pW and the solution is :

7.12 Rotation About a Fixed Point. The motion of a body
rotating about a fixed point is somewhat more complex than the
motions hitherto considered. The spinning top and the gyroscope
are examples of such motion, in which a rigid body rotates about a n
axis which is itself rotating. We shall first give a n analytical treatment which will be suitable for problems of any degree of generality,
and we will show by means of examples how vector methods can be
used to simplify certain special types of problems.
We first require a convenient coordinate system for the description
of the three-dimensional motions involved. Consider the spinning

236

THE DYNAMICS OF RIGID BODIES

top of Fig. 7.23, which rotates about its geometric axis Oz at the same
time that the geometric axis itself rotates about the vertical axis OZ.
Three coordinates will be required to describe the position of the top.
Perhaps the most natural coordinates will be the angle y5, which
describes the rotation of the top about its geometric axis Oz, the
angle 8 which describes the inclination of this geometric axis from
the vertical OZ axis, and the angle I/, which is the angle in the horizontal plane that locates the vertical plane containing the geometric
axis.
In practice, the analysis can be most easily carried out in a

coordinate system which is equivalent to this 4, 8, t,b system. This
may be explained by the introduction of a new x, y, z coordinate
system as shown in Fig. 7.24. XYZ is the same fixed coordinate
system as in Fig. 7.23, and the origin 0 is the fixed point about which
motion occurs. The z-axis is the spin axis of the body, and coincides
with the geometric axis of the top of Fig. 7.23. The x-axis lies along
the intersection of a plane perpendicular to the spin axis Oz and the
horizontal X Y plane, and hence is always in a horizontal plane.
The y-axis is orthogonal to the x, z axes. Note that the xyz system
is neither fixed in space nor attached to the body. The body itself
can be defined by the x'y'z' system which is attached to the body.
z' coincides with z, but the x' and y' are rotated about the z-axis by

ROTATION ABOUT A FIXED POINT

237

the angle 4. The three angles defining the position of the body can
thus be given as 9, c$, and 4, where 4 describes the position of the
horizontal x-axis as measured from the fixed OX axis. Comparing
Figs. 7.23 and 7.24 it will be noted that the angles 9, 4, and are
exactly the same in the two coordinate systems. The angles 9, 4,
and IC, are called Ezcler's Angles and their use, together with the
x, y, z coordinate system as defined above, is especially convenient
for the discussion of the more complex problems of rotation about
a fixed point.
We shall now write the general equations of motion in terms of

+

Euler's Angles. Taking i, j, and k as unit vectors in the x, y, z directions, and w,, w,, and w, as the angular velocity components of the
x, y, z coordinate system, we have for the angular velocity w of the
x, y, z coordinate system:

+ w y j + wzk = Bi + 4 sin 9j + 4 cos 9k
Since the body has an angular velocity of spin 4 with respect to the
w = w,i

x, y, z system, the total angular velocity of the body is :
wa = wxi

+ w u j + (wt + 4)k

The equations of motion are obtained in the usual manner by

23 8

THE DYNAMICS O F RIGID BODIES

writing the equation of moment of momentum, M = H , about the
fixed point 0. As has been shown, this equation, in the rotating
x , y, z system is :
M x = H z - H Y w , + HZwy
M y= H y - H z w z + Hxwz
M z = H z - H,wy + H Y w ,
The w,, w,, w , in these equations are the angular velocity components
of the coordinate system, as defined above. H z , H y , and Hz must
be expressed in terms of the angular velocity components of the
body, so:

The general equations of motion which are obtained by substituting
H z , Hy,
Hz into the above moment equations are rather complex.
We shall not investigate these general equations further, since the
special applications which we shall now consider will permit considerable simplification.

The solution of this set of differential equations subject to the initial
conditions will give a complete description of the motion of the
system. Unfortunately, even for the above symmetrical case,
general solutions of the non-linear differential equations cannot be
obtained, although this is a classical problem which has been
intensively studied. It is thus necessary to consider special types
of problems which represent still further simplifications. One type
of problem that can be solved is the determination of the applied
moments that would correspond to certain steady motions of the
system, as will be illustrated in the examples to follow. I t is also

possible to make an analytical study of the stability of such assumed
steady motions, and hence to justify the assumptions.
An examination of Equations (7.28) shows first the usual terms
involving the angular velocities and the angular accelerations that
would be present even if the body were not spinning about its
geometric axis. In addition, we find the terms ( I , ~ , c $ )and
( - I,w,+) which are consequences of the spin of the body about its
axis. The moments associated with these spin terms are called
gyroscopic moments, and devices in which such terms play a prominent
role are called gyroscopes. Note that the gyroscopic moment about
the x-axis is associated with an angular velocity about the y-axis,

240

THE DYNAMICS OF RIGID BODIES

and vice-versa. The fact that an angular velocity is produced at
right angles to the external moment which causes it is the characteristic peculiarity of the gyroscope. This motion of the spin axis in a
direction perpendicular to the applied moment is called precession.
A gyroscope is often mounted in gimbals so that all rotation is

about the center of mass (Fig. 7.26). Since the equation fi = M
may be written with respect to the center of mass, we see that the
preceding equations are applicable to a gyroscope mounted in
gimbals even though the center of mass is moving.
EXAMPLE
1. A circular disk of moment of inertia I about its
geometrical axis rotates about that axis with an angular velocity R
with respect to the axis. At the same time the axis itself rotates in

a horizontal plane with a precessional angular velocity w,. A gravity
moment of magnitude WL acts on the system as shown in Fig. 7.27.
Find the precessional velocity w, compatible with this steady motion
of the system.

We have, in the notation of Equations (7.29) :

so, from the first equation :

(counterclockwise viewed from top).

Method 2. The simplicity of this particular problem makes
possible a very simple vector solution, as shown in Fig. 7.29. Since

M = A, there must be a AH in the direction of M. If H = Ii2 =
constant, this AH can only come about by a rotation of the whole
axis as shown, in a direction such that AH has the same direction as
M. If the axis moves through an angle A$ in the horizontal XY
plane in a time At, we have:

Thus, Wl

before. Note that in this

particular problem the moment of momentum component associated

THE DYNAMICS OF RIGID BODIES

242

with the precession is always perpendicular to the spin axis and hence
does not enter into the moment equation. This would not in general
be true, and is only a consequence of the fact that in this particular
problem 8 = 90".
EXAMPLE
2. The geometrical axis of a right circular cone of halfangle a and height h makes a
constant angle 8 with the vertical, and rotates about the
vertical axis through the vertex
of the cone with a uniform

angular velocity wp. At the
same time, the cone spins about
its geometric axis with a conY
stant angular velocity w, relative
to the moving axis, as shown in
x
Fig. 7.30. For given constant
values of 8 and w, determine
FIG.7.30
the precessional angular velocity up.
Solution-Method 1. We shall first solve the problem by a direct
application of Equations (7.29). Referring to Fig. 7.30 we note that
for this particular problem we have:
Thus the M x equation becomes:
M x = - I m p 2 sin 8 cos 8

+ I z w p sin 8(wpcos 8 + w )

Also, M , = ($hW sin 8 ) , so we have :

THE SYMMETRICAL TOP AND THE GYROSCOPE

243

Note that this expression gives two positive real values for the precessional angular velocity up. There are thus two precessional
speeds that will satisfy the conditions of the problem. These are
called the slow and the fast precessional motions. I t is the slow
precession which is observed in most simple experiments, and it
would require an analysis of the stability of the assumed motions to
complete the discussion of such problems.
If it is assumed that the angular velocity of precession is small
compared to the spin velocity, a simplified solution to the problem
can be obtained. The moment equation obtained above can be
re-written in the form:

3 Wh

term can be dropped, and we obtain:

Note that as the spin velocity increases the precessional velocity
decreases. Since most gyroscopes have a very high spin velocity, the
assumption that wp < < o is usually a good one.
To compare the result of the approximate analysis with the exact
solution, expand the square root term in the exact answer for wp by
the bionomial theorem :

taking the negative sign and dropping higher order terms in the

The approximate solution thus gives the lower precessional speed.
Method 2. The same results can also be obtained by a direct application of the equation M = fi using the moment of momentum

vector, as in Example 1, Method 2 above. In Fig. 7.31 (a) the precessional angular velocity w, has been resolved into components
along the y and z axes, and in Fig. 7.31 (b) the components of the
moment of momentum of the cone along they and a axes are shown.
As the cone precesses, these H components rotate as shown, and have
increment changes in the x-direction. Then from M = A we obtain :

7.14 The Gyroscopic Compass. Consider a gyroscope that is
mounted at the earth's surface in such a way that it is free to turn
in any direction (Fig. 7.26). If no moment is applied, the axis of
the gyroscope will maintain a fixed direction in space so that as the
earth rotates about its axis the gyroscope axis will rotate relative to
the earth. This is illustrated in Fig. 7.32 (a),in which we are looking
due south at a gyroscope which is mounted on the equator. The
direction of spin of the gyro rotor is indicated by the vector. If now
a small weight is attached to the spin axis below the center of mass,
a moment is impressed upon the gyroscope by gravity as indicated
in Fig. 7.32 (b). This torque, whose vector direction is parallel to

the earth's axis, causes the spin axis to rotate toward the earth's axis.
A device of this type will, therefore, point to true north and can be
used as a compass. The preceding discussion gives a qualitative
indication of the behavior of the gyrocompass, and we shall now show
in more detail how the performance can be predicted from the
equations of motion.
The effect of the pendulous mass is to constrain the spin axis of the
gyroscope to move in a horizontal plane. We therefore take the xz
plane, Fig. 7.32 (c), as the horizontal plane containing the spin axis,
and the z-axis as the direction of spin of the rotating gyro disk. The
location of the spin axis with respect to a meridian is given by the
angle 8,and y is the latitude of the gyroscope, measured from the

246

equator. The angular velocity of the earth is

To determine the motion of the spin axis in the horizontal plane with
respect to the meridian, we use the general equation for the motion
about the y-axis (Equation 7.28) :
My

+ I w s w z - I r w t ( o z + $)

velocity of the gyroscope, the equation becomes:

~y sin /3 cos /3

+ I,QOJE cos y sin /3

Since the angular velocity of the earth WE. is very small compared to
the spin velocity Q, the term containing WE^ may be neglected, and
the equation of motion may be written:

For small oscillations of the spin axis about the meridian we may put
sin /3 x and the equation becomes:

This is the equation of simple harmonic motion, from which it may
be concluded that the spin axis oscillates about the meridian with a
period
I
7 = 277
I n practical applications of the gyrocompass, sufficient damping is
introduced so that the oscillations are damped out with the spin axis
finally lined up with the meridian.
The preceding discussion of gyroscopic motion illustrates a
common procedure in the solution of dynamics problems. -4 completely general solution of such problems, which, starting from the
general equations would consider all possible motions of the system,
often leads to very complex analysis. Since for particular practical

7.15 General Motion in Space. Rolling of a Disk.

restricted type, such as plane motion, or motion about a fixed point,
the general equations of motion can be reduced to relatively simple
forms. In the present section we shall illustrate, b y means of the

particular example of a disk rolling on a horizontal plane, the solution
of more complex systems by application of the general equations of
motion.
A thin uniform circular disk of radius a and mass m rolls without
slipping on a horizontal plane. We are to write the equations of
motion required to give a complete description of all possible motions
of the disk.
We can describe the location and configuration of the system by
giving the two coordinates of the point of contact of the disk and
the plane, and the angles 8, #,
and C$ as shown in Fig. 7.33. Also
shown in the diagram are the

xyz coordinate system whose
origin is at the center of mass of
the disk, and whose y-axis passes
through the point of contact of

The conditions that the disk

For the moment equations we can make use of Equations (7.29),
previously derived for the motion of a body of revolution about a
fixed point. Since the origin of the coordinate system is the center
of mass of the system, the same equations will be valid, and since the
angles used to describe the position of the disk are the same Euler's
angles used for Equations (7.29) we may substitute directly and
obtain :

an example of the use of the equations of the preceding section, we

STABILITY OF THE ROLLING DISK

25 1

shall find the conditions under which stable rolling of the disk in a
straight line is possible. This will also serve as an illustration of one
type of stability investigation. In general, the conditions of stability
of a given state of motion are determined by introducing a small perturbation of some kind into the motion. If in this perturbed state a
restoring force is set up which tends to return the system to its original
condition, the motion is said to be stable. In addition t o this
restoring force it may also be required that there be damping forces
so that any oscillatory motions would decay.

at a distance a from the vertex. Find a as a function of R, and determine
the limiting value of R for which such a rolling motion is possible.

vertical. Using the general theory developed for the rolling disk, find the
value of R for which such a stable spinning motion will be possible.
7.17 D'Alembert's Principle. I t was pointed out by D'Alembert that Newton's Second Law of Motion could be considered from
a slightly different viewpoint by writing it in the form :

and treating the term (-mi.') as if it were a force. When this is done
the terms ( -mi.') are called inertiaforces, and it should be particularly
noted that inertia forces are not actual forces in the sense that the
word "force" has been used in the preceding portion of this book.
The concept of the inertia force makes it possible to apply the
general methods of statics to the solution of dynamics problems, since
Newton's Law may be written as ZF = 0 if it is understood that
inertia forces are to be included in the summation.
This viewpoint can be extended to systems of particles and to
rigid bodies. For any system of particles we have

For a rigid body performing plane motion, the equations of motion
are :
CF = m i ,
CMC = Ice
These may be written:
EF + (-mi.',) = 0
CMC + ( - I , @ = 0
where rc is the acceleration of the center of mass of the body, and I ,
is the moment of inertia of the body about the center of mass. If
we imply that the inertia force ( -mi.',) and the inertia torque ( - 1,8)
are included in the summation, we have the equations in the same
form as the equations of statics:
EF = 0
CM=O
I t should be noted that in this moment equation, the moments can
be taken about any axis, as in statics, since the inertia torque has
already been included with the appropriate moment of inertia about

254

THE DYNAMICS OF RIGID BODIES

the mass center. I t is this feature which may sometimes lead to a
simplification in writing the equations of motion for a system.
Since any point can be taken as a moment center it is sometimes
possible to select a point through which several unknown forces pass,
thus eliminating such unknown forces from the equations. The
equations of motion as formulated in the previous sections of thc
present chapter, on the other hand, usually require that sonw
particular point such as the mass center or a fixed point should be
used as the moment center.
The introduction of the concept of an inertia force and an inertia
torque does not, of course, represent any new information. For
some problems, however, this method of writing the equation of
motion leads to a convenient way of visualizing the dynamics of a
situation, as will be illustrated in the following examples. D'Alembert's principle is also often used for non-rigid systems, as in
Prob. 7.107. By applying the appropriate inertia force to each
element of the system in such cases, a complete description of the
dynamics of the system is obtained. I t is important to note that
D'Alembert's method should be considered as an alternative to the
method employed previously in this chapter, and that mixing the
two methods in one solution can lead to considerable confusion. In
such a case it is quite possible that the same term will be included
twice-once in the guise of an inertia force, and once as an acceleration term.
The concept of an inertia force can be combined with the principle
of virtual displacements to give Lagrange's form of D'Alembert's
principle. For example, the equation of motion for a particle is:

If, according to D'Alembert's notion, we consider this to be an
equation of static equilibrium, the principle of virtual displacements
states that :
( m r - F).6r = 0
where 6r is a virtual displacement. The general statement of
D'Alembert's principle for a system of particles is:

,

D'ALEMBERT'S PRINCIPLE

255

This is the equation from which Lagrange developed analytical
mechanics. I t introduces into dynamics the same advantage that
the principle of virtual displacements introduces into statics-the
conditions of equilibrium or of motion may be studied without introducing the constraining forces which may be acting. A further
development of this method of formulation of the dynamics problem
will be discussed in Chapter 9.
EXAMPLE
1. Solve the problem of the example of Section 7.9
using the concept of the inertia force.
Solution. We draw a free-body diagram indicating the forces as
solid vectors and the inertia forces as dotted vectors (Fig. 7.34). The

inertia force ( - mx,) is shown a t the center of mass of the system.
Since the body is translating, there is no inertia torque acting on the
system. The problem has now been reduced to a problem in statics,
and the equations may be written:
XFx
CF,

=
=

0 = F x - ~ N -A pNg - mx,
0 = - F , + N A + N B - mg

These equations lead directly to the solution given in the example
of Section 7.9. Note that we have taken advantage of the fact that
any point can be selected as the moment center, and have picked the
point A , which eliminates several unknown forces from the equatiops.

NON-RIGID SYSTEMS O F PARTICLES

But I consider philosophy rather than the arts and write not concerning
manual but natural powers, and consider chiefly those things which relate to
gravity, levity, elastic forces, the resistance of fluids, and the like forces,
whether attractive or impulsive.-I. Newton, Principia Philosophiae (1686).

The analysis of the dynamics of systems of particles is greatly
influenced by the characteristics of the particular system being
studied. For example, solid bodies, fluids, and gases are all systems
of particles and as such can be treated by the general methods of
dynamics which have already been discussed. The physical
characteristics of these various systems differ so greatly, however,
that the analysis must be handled in a distinctive fashion for the
various materials. The analysis is, of course, always based upon
the equations of motion, but it is developed in different ways in
order to take advantage of the particular characteristics of a given
system.
I n the following sections some of the methods which can be
applied to non-rigid systems of particles, such as elastic bodies,
fluids, and gases will be briefly discussed. The non-rigid system
which is most closely related to the rigid body of the preceding
chapter is the elastic body, in which small motions of the particles
with respect to each other may occur. These small motions may be
the only motions involved in the problem, or they may be superimposed on a "rigid-body'' motion of the whole system.
8.1 Longitudinal Waves in an Elastic Bar. As one example
of a type of dynamics problem in which the motions are associated
262

LONGITUDINAL WAVES I N AN ELASTIC BAR

263

with the non-rigidity of the system, we shall consider the propagation
of elastic strain waves in a long, slender bar.
Fig. 8.1 (a) shows a portion of a long, slender bar of uniform
cross section area A , and of density p. I t is supposed that loads are
applied in such a way that only longitudinal strains are set up, and
translational motions of the bar as a rigid body will not be considered. It will be assumed that plane sections normal to the axis
of the bar remain plane, i.e., the axial stresses and strains are
uniformly distributed across the area of the bar.
Referring to Fig. 8.1 (a),consider a section of the bar located at a
distance x from a reference point. During the strain of the bar, this
section is displaced a distance u from its original position, while
another section, originally at a distance x + dx is displaced by u + du.
The total elongation of the element of length dx is thus du, and the

a~

strain is -, which we write as a partial derivative since the displaceax
ments u will be functions of both x and t.
If it is assumed that the material of the bar obeys Hooke's law, the

uniformly distributed stress across the bar will be o = E -, and the

NON-RIGID SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES

The solution of this partial differential equation, subject to
prescribed initial and boundary conditions, leads to a complete
description of all motions permitted by the basic assumptions. I t
will next be shown that the solution to Equation (8.1) can be
obtained in two different forms, which must, of course, be physically
equivalent, but which lead to two different points of view for
problems of this kind.
8.2 The Traveling Wave Solution. Consider a function of the
form
u = f (x - ct)

where j indicates any function and c =

We now investigate the physical interpretation of a solution in the
form of Equation (8.2). Fig. 8.2 (a) shows a representation of the
function u = f (x - ct) when t = 0. In Fig. 8.2 (b) the more general
case u = f ( x - ct), t > 0 is plotted in an xo, uo coordinate system
which has been transformed by the translation along the x-axis
x = xo + ct. I t will be noted that this transformation has the effect
of moving the u-axis to the right by an amount ct. In this new

THE TRAVELING WAVE SOLUTION

+

coordinate system we have uo = f ( X O ct - ct) = f ( x o ) and hence
in the translated coordinate system the same shape of function f (xo)
is obtained that was originally plotted for t = 0. I t is thus evident
that as time increases, and hence the distance ct increases, the
original curve f ( x ) can be thought of as moving along the x-axis to
the right with a constant velocity c.
I t will thus be seen that a solution of the form f ( x - ct) represents
physically a wave traveling along the bar with a velocity c

=

J:.

For this reason Equation (8.1) is often called the one-dimensional
wave equation. The wave equation in more general terms is:

the solutions of which describe waves that can be propagated in

certain three-dimensional systems, as, for example, sound waves
in air.
By repeating the steps which lead to the solution u = f ( x - ct) it
can be shown that the solution u = f ( x + ct) also satisfies the wave
equation, and that it represents a wave traveling to the left with the
velocity c. The solution u = f ( x It ct) thus represents two waves
traveling in opposite directions with equal constant velocities c.
Since Equation (8.1)is linear, a general solution can be built up from
the two wave solutions by superposition, thus giving:

The forms of the functions fi and fz can be determined from the

266

NON-RIGID SYSTEMS O F PARTICLES

prescribed initial conditions.

If, for example, the initial displace-

ments are uo(x) and the initial velocities are

($)we would have

:

where fl(x) and f&) are the shapes of the two oppositely moving
waves.
A superposition of waves may also be used to satisfy the boundary
conditions a t the ends of the bar. Consider two identical waves as
in Fig. 8.3 (a). In this figure we will plot a

=

)E:(

instead of u,

so that the waves are stress waves, and we show the positions of the
waves a t three successive intervals of time.

If the two waves are of equal sign and are mirror-images, then
point A midway between the waves will a t all times be in equilibrium,
and will hence remain a t rest. The point A, therefore, can represent
a fixed point of the bar, as at a built-in end. We thus conclude that
a wave is "reflected" froni a fixed end of the bar as a mirror image
of the same sign as the original wave, i.e., a tension wave reflects from
a fixed end as a similar tension wave.
If we now imagine that the two approaching waves have the same
form but are of opposite sign, as in Fig. 8.4 (a), we note that a t the
midpoint A the stresses cancel but the displacements add, Point A
thus in this case corresponds to a free end of a bar, and we conclude
that a wave is reflected from a free end with a change in sign, i.e.,
a tension wave reflects from a free end as a similar compression wave.
I n connection with the above discussion of wave propagation, it

T H E TRAVELING WAVE SOLUTIOK

267

will be useful to refer back to Prob. 3.38, where it is indicated how the
velocity of propagation of elastic waves can be calculated from
impulse-momentum principles.

EXAMPLE.A longitudinal stress wave of the shape shown in
Fig. 8.5 starts a t the free end of a bar of length 1 and travels down
the bar toward a built-in end. What time will elapse before the bar
will again be in its original configuration ?
Sol.ution. Since the wave reflects from a fixed end with the same
sign, and from the free end with a reversed sign, it will require four
complete traverses of the bar to get the wave back to its original
configuration, as shown in Fig. 8.6 which indicates the sequence of

events. Each traverse takes a time t

longitudinal to-and-fro motion of the individual particles, niay be
thought of as a vibration of the bar. The time calculated above
may thus be regarded as the fundamental period of longitudinal
vibration of the bar.
I n the next section this vibration problem will be studied from
another point of view.
8.3 The Longitudinal Vibrations of a Bar. We shall now
return to Equation (8.1) and show that a different form of solution
can be obtained.
The differential equation is :

Try as a solution a function of the form:

where ul(t) is a function of t alone, and uz(x) is a function of x alone.
Substituting this trial solution into the differential equation gives:

or:

The left side of this equation is a function of t alone, and the right
is a function of x alone; these two sides can be equal only if they
equal the same constant. If we call this constant (-p?), we have:

which leads to the two equations:

By the use of the product solution technique the single partial
differential equation has been replaced by two ordinary differential

THE LONGITUDINAL VIBRATIONS OF A BAR

269

equations. This method is often useful in the solution of partial
differential equations.
Equation (8.3) will be seen to be the simple vibration equation as
discussed in Chapter 5, the solution of which is:
u l ( t ) = A sin pt + B cos pt
where p is the frequency of the vibrations.
Equation (8.4) is an equation of similar form, and will have the
solution :
u z ( x ) = C sin P- x
C

+ D cos P-C x.

And thus a solution of the differential equation is:
u(x,t)

=

( A sin pt

+ B cos pt)

+ D cos 2C x )

(8.5)

We shall show how a complete solution of the differential equation
can be formed from solutions of the above type by considering a
specific example. Suppose that we are to determine the natural
frequencies of longitudinal vibrations of a uniform slender bar of
length I , area A , material of density p, that is free at one end and
built in at the other end. The boundary conditions are :
( 1 ) at the free end ( x = 0 ) the strain is zero, therefore

For a non-trivial solution D # 0 , so we have as a requirement for

C

There are an infinite number of values pn which satisfy this equation,

NON-RIGID SYSTEMS O F PARTICLES

270

corresponding to the fundamental frequency and the higher
harmonics.
The situation represented by Equation (8.6),in which a differential
equation and its boundary conditions are satisfied only for a particular set of values of some parameter, often occurs in problems in
applied mathematics. These are called the "characteristic values "
or " eigenvalues " for the problem.
In this particular case, the natural frequencies of vibration of the
bar are given by the solution of Equation (8.6) :

I t will be recalled that in Chapter 5 vibrating systems having one
degree of freedom and hence one natural frequency of vibration were
discussed. The elastic body is a system having an infinite number
of degrees of freedom and hence, as we would expect, there are an
infinite number of natural frequencies.
The fundamental frequency of longitudinal vibrations is the
lowest of the above values:

The fundamental period of the vibration is:

Note that this agrees with the answer obtained by wave propagation
techniques in the example of the preceding section.
The fact that there are an infinite number of frequency parameters
p, that will satisfy an equation of the type of Equation ( 8 . 5 ) for a
given set of boundary conditions enables us to form a complete solution to the problem. Since the original differential equation is linear,
solutions of the type of Equation (8.5) can be superimposed to give
a complete solution which will satisfy the initial conditions of displacement and velocity as well as the boundary conditions. This
general solution will thus be of the form :

I t will often be found that many problems can be analyzed either
as a wave propagation or as the superposition of harmonic solutions.
Depending on the type of loading, the initial and boundary conditions, and on the information desired, one or the other of the
methods may be preferable.

PROBLEMS

waves along the string.
(b) Find the lowest natural frequency of vibration for small transverse
motions of the string.

8.4 The Equations of Motion of a Non-viscous Fluid. In the
analysis of fluid motion it is possible t o introduce certain simplifications because of the special properties of fluids. First, it is not
necessary to treat the fluid as being composed of discrete particles.
Instead, we consider it to be composed of elements of volume dV,
an element having a mass pdV, where p is the density of the fluid.
Second, we make use of the fact that the pressure at a point in a fluid
is the same in all directions:

The equation of motion for an element of fluid is:

where v is the velocity of the element andZF is the resultant force
acting upon the element. In rectangular coordinates the equations
of motion are:
(p dx dy dz)R = CF, etc.

Fig. 8.7 (a) shows a free-body diagram of a fluid element. If we
assume a perfect or non-viscous fluid, there are no viscous shearing
forces on the sides of the element, so that the only forces are the
normal forces acting on the faces, and the gravity force acting a t the
center of the element. I n Fig. 8.7 (b) are shown the pressures
exerted on two faces of the element. The pressure at the center of
the element is taken to be p. Then on the right face of the element,
a t a distance

%'from the center, the pressure is

2

EQUATIONS OF MOTION OF A NON-VISCOUSFLUID

whereas on the left face the pressure is

dy
(p - 3
a j T)

273

Since the

force in the Y-direction is given by the pressure multiplied by the
area on which it acts:

The minus sign occurs because for

9
w positive the resultant force

acts in the negative ydirection. The Y-component of the equation of motion now may be written:

274

NON-RIGID SYSTEMS O F PARTICLES

In the %and z directions the equations are found in the same way
to be:

or, in vector notation:

With this equation it is possible to determine the motion when the
pressure distribution is known, or to determine the pressure distribution when the motion is known.
There is an obvious difficulty in the practical application of this
equation, since, in general, neither the motion nor the pressure in the
fluid will be known. The only facts that are usually known are
certain boundary values, such as the pressures at free surfaces or the
directions of the velocity a t a boundary, etc. The problem is to find
the motion that will satisfy both the differential equation of motion
and the particular boundary conditions. In general, this is a
difficult problem, and many special techniques have been developed
to analyze such fluid dynamics problems. These methods are
treated in texts on hydrodynamics and aerodynamics. In the
following paragraphs, we shall discuss only two of such special
methods-that of the energy equation, and that of the momentum
equation.
8.5 The Energy Equation. The equation of motion for an
element of the fluid can be integrated directly to obtain the workenergy equation. Assuming an incompressible fluid, that is p =
constant, forming the dot product with d r and integrating, we
obtain :

BERNOULLI'S EQUATION BY EULER'S METHOD

275

Collecting terms, this equation may be written:

This states that the sum of the three terms is the same at all points,
or :
$pv2 + p + pgz = constant
(8.9)
This equation applies to an element of fluid no matter what type of
fluid motion is involved. In fluid-mechanics problems, however, it
is not in general possible to follow the motion of one particular
element, and the usefulness of the above equation lies in the fact that,
subject to certain restrictions, the equation can be applied from
point to point in a fluid. The nature of these restrictions may be
shown in the following way. A streamline in a fluid is defined as a
line which has at every point the direction of the velocity of the fluid
at that point. If we assume steady flow of the fluid, that is, no
change with time, then at any point along a stream-line, successive
fluid elements will have identical characteristics. The above
equation can thus be applied between any two points on a streamline in a steady flow. Equation 8.9 is the well-known Bernoulli's
Equation.
8.6 Bernoulli's Equation by Euler's Method. In the preceding discussion of fluid motion we selected a particular element of
fluid and studied the forces on and the motion of that element. This
is, of course, the procedure that we have used for all of the problems
hitherto taken up in this book. This was the general method used
by Lagrange in studying fluid mechanics, and hence this procedure
in such problems is usually called the Lagrangian method. I t is also
possible to adopt a somewhat different point of view, by considering
a fixed point in space and observing the motion of the fluid as it
passes that point. The aim of the equations will then be to describe
what happens to a particle at the instant that it arrives a t a particular
fixe-d point, rather than to describe the path of the particle throughout its motion. This was the method used by Euler, and for many
fluid mechanics problems it has advantages over the Lagrangian
formulation. We shall now derive Bernoulli's equation from this
Eulerian point of view as a comparison with the derivation of the
preceding section. An advantage of the Eulerian method for this

276

NON-RIGID SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES

particular problem will be the fact that the non-steady problem can
also be considered in the derivation if desired.
Consider a volume element in the form of a section of a tube along
a stream-line, as in Fig. 8.8. The
cross-section area of the streamtube is da and the length of the
element is ds. We shall suppose
that this elementary volume is
fixed in space, and we shall consider the fluid flowing through it.
The equation of motion for the
mass which occupies the volume at
a given instant will now be written.
We observe that the- acceleration
of this mass will consist of two
parts; first, the velocity of the fluid in the element may vary along
the length of the element (the velocity is assumed to be constant
across the area), and second, at a given point the velocity may vary
with time. Thus, we have:

av
as

The term v - may be thought of as the acceleration associated with
the particle moving from one point to another point where the
av
at

velocity is different. The term - is the acceleration associated with
the change of flow with time at any one point.
The equation F = ma can now be written, summing the force
components along a stream-line :

Noting that cos a

this becomes:

derivation t o steady flow, for which - = 0, we obtain

Integrating this equation along the stream-line we obtain Bernoulli's
equation :
i p v 2 + fi + pgz = constant.

EXAMPLE.There is a steady flow of fluid from a reservoir through
a pipe as shown in Fig. 8.9. Assuming no energy loss in the system,
find the velocity v e with which the fluid issues from the pipe.

Solution. Applying the energy equation to the two points A and
B gives:
4pvA2

+ * A + P@A

= *pug2

+ PB + P@B

At point A the velocity of the fluid is very small so that to a good
approximation V A = 0. The pressure a t A is atmospheric pressure,
and we can assume with good accuracy that the pressure a t B is also
atmospheric. Thus:

PROBLEMS
8.5. A solid body is placed in a fluid which flows uniformly with an
undisturbed velocity vo. The fluid divides to flow around the body, and
at one point S the fluid comes to rest. If p, is the "stagnation pressure"

278

NON-RIGID SYSTEMS O F PARTICLES

at the stagnation point S,and Po is the pressure at the same depth in the
undisturbed fluid, find p, in terms of P o , vo, and the density of the fluid p.

8.6. The velocity of fluid flow is often measured by a device called a
Venturi meter, which consists of a section of pipe of a gradually reduced
area, as shown in the figure. Find the velocity of flow v in terms of the
known areas A 1 and A z , and the measured pressures $1 and $2. In the
actual instrument a correction coefficient must be applied to account for
non-uniform flow conditions and for friction losses.
8.7. Fluid flows over a weir as shown in the diagram. By applying the
energy equation to elements in thc top surface of the fluid, express the
velocity a t any point in the surface as a function of z.

8.8. A pressure vessel is partly filled with liquid and partly with gas
under a pressure PI. Find the discharge velocity v .

THE MOMENTUM EQUATION

8.10. A horizontal pipe of length I and cross-section area A is connected to the bottom of a large tank as shown in the figure. The free
surface of the fluid in the tank is a distance k above the pipe. A valve at

the end of the pipe is suddenly opened to the atmosphere, and fluid begins
to flow from the pipe. Find the way in which the outflow velocity
increases with time, and find the time required to reach the steady value.
Assume that the velocities of all the fluid particles in the pipe are equal,
and that the velocity of all of the fluid in the tank is zero.

8.7 The Momentum Equation. For some types of fluid
problems, the equations of motion are found to be in their most
convenient form when expressed in terms of a momentum principle.
To derive a general momentum equation in a form suitable for fluid
applications, we shall use the Eulerian approach, as described in the
preceding section.
As in Fig. 8.8 above, let us consider the fluid flowing through a
particular volume dV = da ds which is fixed in space. If F is the

280

NON-RIGID SYSTEMS O F PARTICLES

resultant force acting on the fluid within the volume d V , then we
have :

Also, as shown above:

so we obtain:

We next refer to Fig. 8.10, in which a total volume V fixed in space

is considered. We imagine that this volume is made up of streamtubes, of which a typical one is shown dotted. The preceding
equation, which applies to the typical dotted stream-tube, can now
be integrated over the total volume V to give:

where Z F is the resultant force acting on all of the fluid within the
volume V . We shall now transform these integrals into forms which
are readily evaluated.
Using the formula for the derivative of a product, we have:

indicates that this term is to be evaluated

a t the two end points of the stream-tube; that is, at the points where
the stream tube intersects the boundary of the volume. The resulting area integral is to be evaluated, therefore, over the areas of the
ends of the stream-tubes lying on the surface of the volume. We
note that the direction of a stream-tube as it intersects the boundary
is in general inclined a t some angle to the normal to the boundary
surface. If the vector dA, normal to the surface and directed out
of the volume, describes the increment of surface area, then on the
surface v da = v-dA, and the area integral may be written as:

Since pv.dA represents the mass flow per unit time out through dA,
the term pv(v -dA)represents the rate a t which momentum is flowing
out through dA. The integral thus represents the net rate of outflow
of momentum through the surface of V .
We thus obtain finally the following expression for the resultant
force acting upon the fluid within the volume V:

The first term represents the time rate of change of the total
momentum of the fluid within the element at a particular time, and
the second term represents the total momentum per unit time passing
through the area of the element. Note particularly that this form
of Newton's law does not apply to a particular mass element, but
rather considers a fixed volume element within which the mass may
be changing. The above analysis places no restrictions upon the
compressibility or viscosity of the fluid.
The foregoing analysis can be repeated, beginning with the equation of moment of momentum of the fluid within the fixed element of
volume dV :

T H E MOMENTUM EQUATION

283

and the following result will be obtained:

where XMt is the resultant moment acting on the fluid within the
volume V about some fixed point 0, and H is the total moment of
momentum of the fluid within the volume about the point 0.
The essence of the momentum flow method is that instead of
observing a particular mass element of fluid during its motion,
attention is focused on a region of space. By noting the inflow and
outflow of momentum and the change of momentum within the
region it is possible to deduce the resultant force acting on the fluid
within the region.

1. A pipe of uniform cross-sectional area A has a
horizontal offset I as showR in Fig. 8.12 (a). Fluid flows through the
pipe with a uniform velocity v. Find the moment exerted on the
pipe by the fluid.
Solu,tion. Considering the flow of momentum through the volume
of the pipe indicated in the figures, and evaluating the integral
Spv(v.dA) we obtain the two vectors of magnitude pv2A shown in
Fig. 8.12 (a). Note that the directions are such that both these
vectors are pointing out of the volume. There is thus a counterclockwise moment of magnitude pv2Al exerted upon the fluid within
the volume. This moment is the resultant of the moment due to the

284

NON-RIGID SYSTEMS O F PARTICLES

pressure forces, and the moment M, which is applied to the fluid by
the pipe (Fig. 8.12 b). Thus :

The moment exerted on the pipe by the fluid is equal and opposite
to M,, and is hence a clockwise moment of magnitude (pv2 $)Ad.

Solution. Fig. 8.14 shows the
momentum flow vectors S p ( v . d ~ and

the pressure forces acting
upon the volume of fluid. The resultant momentum-flow vector
is equal to the force acting upon the fluid within the pipe as shown
in (b). This resultant force is the sum of the two pressure forces,
and the force F, exerted by the pipe on the fluid. This force F , can

thus be found as shown in (c). The fluid exerts a force on the pipe
which is equal and opposite t o F,, and hence the external force
which must be applied to the pipe in order to maintain it in equilibrium is F,, directed as shown in (c).

8.11. Fluid is discharged from a tank with velocity v through an outlet
of area A . Show that in order to maintain equilibrium of the system an
external force F = 2(pB - P A ) A must act as shown in the figure, where
P A is the atmospheric pressure, and pe is the pressure within the tank at
the same elevation as the outlet, at a point where the fluid velocity is zero.

8.12. A stream of fluid impinges on a stationary surface as shown in the
diagram. Find the force exerted by the fluid on the surface, by the
method of the preceding section.
8.13. An incompressible fluid flows through a pipe which has a change
in cross-section as shown. Both ends of the pipe are at the same elevation.

Assuming that the velocity is uniform across the area of both sections,
find the force exerted on the pipe by the fluid.
8.14. Three pipes each of uniform cross-section lie in a horizontal plane
and converge at a point as shown in the figure. Fluid flows through A1

dimensions of the system are such that Azvz = gA1vl. Find the resultant
force required to hold the joint in equilibrium, assuming that the velocities
are uniform across the sections of the pipe, and that the pressure in the
fluid is negligible.

8.15. Carry through the steps indicated in the text leading to Equation (8.11) above, and thus derive the expression for the moment of
momentum relationship in fluid flow.
8.16. A frictionless compressible fluid flows through a straight pipe.
An object B is held in a fixed position in the stream. Assuming that there
is steady flow, find the relation between the force exerted by the fluid on B,
and the velocities, densities, and pressures of the fluid at the two ends of
the pipe.

8.17. When the area of a pipe in which fluid is flowing increases, the
velocity of the fluid decreases and hence the pressure increases. Compare
this increase of pressure in the two cases shown in the diagram. In (a) the
pipe increases suddenly in area from A1 to Az, while in (b) the transition
is made gradually. Note that in (a) there will be a mixing region of
irregular flow, but that after a certain distance the flow will be again
approximately uniform with an averge velocity vz. The pressure change
in case (a) may be determined, without a consideration of the details in

MOMENTUM EQUATION F O R ACCELERATING VOLUME 287

volume shown in (a).

8.8 The Momentum Equation for an Accelerating Volume.
In the preceding section we considered the problem of flow of a fluid
through a stationary volume. We shall now consider the more
general problem in which the volume itself is accelerating. This is,
for example, the type of problem involved in an analysis of the
dynamics of rocket flight.
Let the absolute velocity of a point in the fluid be v and consider
a coordinate system fixed in the moving volume. If v , is the velocity
of a point in the fluid relative to the moving coordinate system and u
is the absolute velocity of the corresponding point in the coordinate
system, then v = v , + u . Let s be measured along a stream-line
in the moving coordinate system. By a stream-line in the moving
coordinate system we mean a line which has everywhere the direction
of v,. We may now write:

The resultant external force acting upon the mass contained within
the volume is:

This integral may be transformed in the same way as the corresponding integral obtained for the fixed volume of the preceding
section, with the result :

288

NON-RIGID SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES

is the total momentum of the mass within the volume at
where
any instant, and the integral represents the net rate of outflow of
momentum from the volume. Note that the term p ( v , . d A ) is the
mass per unit time which passes through the surface d A , and hence
physically is the same thing as the p ( v - d A ) term obtained for the
fixed volume.
From the moment of momentum relationship the following
equation can be derived :

H represents the total moment of momentum of the mass within the
volume under consideration, and EM$ is the resultant external
torque acting upon the material within the volume. H and XMt
may be measured either with respect
to a fixed point or with respect to the
r-------moving center of mass of the system.
I If H and CMt are measured with re[ spect to the moving center of mass.
L- ------- A
however, the velocity v appearing in
FIG.8.15
Equation (8.13) is no longer the absolute velocity as used in the preceding
analysis, but is the velocity of the element with respect to the center
of mass.
EXAMPLE
1. A rocket travels in straight horizontal flight. Theexhaust velocity of the jet relative to the rocket is v, and the gage pressure
in the jet of area A is p. The mass of fuel burned per unit time is
p , A and the total mass of the rocket at any time is m = m~ - pv,At.
Assuming that gravity forces and drag forces are negligible, derive
the differential equation of motion of the rocket, and find the
velocity of the rocket as a function of time.
Solution. As the volume to which momentum flow considerations
are to be applied let us take the complete rocket, including shell and
propellant, as in Fig. 8.15. This volume is attached to the rocket,
and hence moves with the same velocity u as the rocket. The only
external force acting on the material within the volume is P A , since
gravity and drag forces are assumed negligible, and hence Equation (8.12) gives directly :

principles should be compared with the special rocket problems discussed previously in Chapter 3.

Chapter 9
ADVANCED METHODS IN DYNAMICS

"When one obtains a simple result by means of complicated calculations,
there must exist a more direct method of obtaining the result; the simplifications which occur and the terms which disappear during the course of the
calculations are certain indications that a method exists for which these
simplifications have already been made and in which these terms do not
appear."-M. Lam&,Thborie de l'%la.sticitb (1866).

As the problems in dynamics become more complex it naturally
becomes increasingly difficult to work out the solutions. This
difficulty is associated not only with the solution of the equations of
motion, but with their formulation as well. In fact, the derivation
of the basic differential equations of motion in a form suitable for a
particular complicated problem may well be the most difficult part
of the investigation. A number of methods, more powerful than
those hitherto considered in this book, have been developed for
deriving the equations for these more involved situations. Perhaps
the most generally useful of these more advanced methods for
engineering problems is that of Lagrange, who has put the basic
equations of motion in such a form that the simplifying features of a
particular problem can be utilized most advantageously. I n the
present chapter we shall derive Lagrange's equations, and we shall
indicate their application by a number of examples.
9.1 Generalized Coordinates. One of the principal advantages
of Lagrange's method is that one uses for each problem that coordinate system which most conveniently describes the motion.
We have already seen that the position of a particle can be described
in a large number of different ways, and we have found in the
293

294

ADVANCED METHODS IN DYNAMICS

problems already discussed that the choice of a proper coordinate
system may introduce a considerable simplification into the solution
of a problem. In general, the requirement for a system of coordinates is that the specification of the coordinates must locate
completely the position of each part of the system. This means that
there must be one coordinate associated with each degree of freedom
of the system.* We shall restrict the following treatment to systems
whose coordinates are independent, in the sense that a change can
be given to any one of the coordinates without changing any of the
other coordinates.? By the generalized coordinates ( 9 1 , qz, . . . qn)
we shall mean a set of independent coordinates, equal in number to
the degrees of freedom of the system. We use the word "generalized " to emphasize the fact that such coordinates are not necessarily
of the type of the simple ( x , y ,z ) or ( r ,0, $) systems which we have
already used, and to indicate that they are not necessarily lengths or
angles, but may be any quantity appropriate to the description of
the position of the system.
The ( x , y , z) coordinates of a point are expressible in terms of the
generalized coordinates ( 9 1 , 92, q3) by functional relations::

For example, if (ql, q2, q3) are the cylindrical coordinates ( r , 0, z )
the foregoing equations become:
The equations of motion in generalized coordinates for any particular system could always be obtained by writing the equations

* Morc exactly, there must be a t least one coordinate associated with each
degree of freedom. So called non-holo?~onzicsystems exist, for which, because
of t h e particular geometrical constraints involved, more coordinates are
required than thcre are degrees of freedom. Such systems are not often
encountered and will not be considered here. See Appendix I, references 32
and 33.
t I n some problems it may be more convenient to use coordinates which are
not all independent. See Appendix I, references 2, 7, 32, and 33.
W e havc supposed t h a t t h e relation betwecn the coordinate systems does
not involve time. I n the more general treatment in which x = d ( q l , qa, . . . qn, 1 )
the analysis can proceed along essentially the same lines. Sec Appendix I ,

first in an (x, y, z) system, and then transforming to the q's by
Equations (9.1). This procedure usually leads to involved algebraic
manipulations, and it is better to make the transformation in general
terms and to write the equations of motion directly in generalized
coordinates.
9.2 Lagrange's Equations for a Particle. We shall first show
how the transformation to generalized coordinates may be made
for one particle. The extension to systems of particles will be a
direct one involving only a summation of the result over all of the
particles of the system.
The equations of motion of the particle will first be written in the
form :
F, = mx
F , = my
F , = mi
Multiply through the first equation by 6x, the second equation by
6y, and the third equation by 62, and add the resulting equations:
The quantities ax, 6y and 62 are small displacements, and they have
been written as deltas to emphasize that they may have arbitrary
values, consistent with the physical restraints, and hence are not
differentials.* The quantities ax, 6y and 62 are virtual displacements,
in the sense that this term is used in statics, and Equation (9.2)
is equivalent to Equation (7.30) previously obtained by a combination
of D'Alembertls Principle and the Principle of Virtual Displacements.
We now transform the coordinates in Equation (9.2) from the
(x, y, z) coordinates to the (ql, 92, q3) system, using the general transformation Equations (9.1) above. From Equation (9.1) the displacements 6x, 6y, and 62 can be written in terms of the q's as:

* If, for example, in a particular situation y = ax2, then dy = 2axdx, and
dy and dx are related. The symbol d rather than 6 would be used in such a
case to indicate that dy is not arbitrary but depends upon the value of dx.

ADVANCED METHODS IN DYNAMICS

296

In order to introduce a simplification into the algebra of the derivation, we shall now suppose that 6ql f 0 while 6q2 = 693 = 0.
This is permissible since we have defined the generalized coordinates
above as independent coordinates. Equations (9.3) thus become:

Substituting these values into Equation (9.2), we obtain:

(9.4)
The left side of Equation (9.4) has a simple physical meaning:
it is the work done by the external forces of the system during the
displacement 641. We shall equate this work to the expression
(Q18ql) and thus define the generalized force Q1 as:

This definition of the generalized force Q indicates the way in which
Q can be determined in specific problems. To find Qr, the total
work done by all of the external forces during a small displacement
696 of one of the coordinates is calculated, and Qr is then obtained by
dividing this total work by 6qr. I t should be noted that the generalized force does not necessarily have the dimensions of a force; for
example, if qt is an angle, 6qt is dimensionless, and Qc would have the
dimensions [FlLlTO]. In this particular case, Qa would be a moment.
Similarly if the generalized coordinate is a volume, then the dimensions of the generalized force would be [FlL-ZTO].
We next transform the right side of Equation (9.4). From the
formula for the differentiation of a product we have:

From Equations (9.1) we may write:

so that:

LAGRANGE'S EQUATIONS FOR A PARTICLE

297

We may also put:

With these substitutions, Equation (9.6) becomes:

Substituting this into the right hand side of Equation (9.4)along with
similar expressions for y and z , we obtain:

But the kinetic energy T of the particle is:

T = & m ( i 2+ y2

+ t2)

So we have :

from which :

This is Lagrange's equation in the form in which it is most useful for
engineering problems.
If in the above derivation we had put 8qz # 0 while 691 = 6q3 = 0,
we would have obtained the same Equation (9.7) in terms of qz
instead of q l , and in a similar way an equation in terms of 43 could be
obtained. The above procedure thus leads to three independent
Lagrangian equations of motion corresponding to the three degrees
of freedom of the single particle, which we can write as:

If the forces acting on the system are conservative forces, so that
they can be derived from a potential energy V we may say by
definition that :

298

ADVANCED METHODS I N DYNAMICS

Thus for conservative systems Lagrange's equations can be written
in the form:

The potential energy V is a function of the generalized coordinates
qt but does not involve the velocities

(it,

av

thus - = 0, and Equation
841

(9.10) may be written in the form :

where L = (T - V). The quantity L, the difference between the
kinetic and the potential energy, is called the Lagrangian Function,
or the Kinetic Potential of the system.
I t should be noted that Lagrange's
equations in the form of Equations
(9.10) or (9.11) apply to conservative
systems only, whereas Equation (9.8)
applies to non-conservative systems as
well.
EXAMPLE
1. Derive the equations
of motion for a particle in cylindrical
coordinates, using Lagrange's equations.
Solution. In this problem we have :

The kinetic energy T of the particle is:
T = hm(i2 + 7 2 4 2 + i 2 )
Thus, Lagrange's equation for the r-coordinate becomes:

EXAMPLE2. A simple pendulum consisting of a concentrated mass m and a
weightless string of length I is mounted on
a massless support which is elastically restrained horizontally by means of a spring
having a spring constant k, as shown in
Fig. 9.2. Write the equations of motion
for the system, using Lagrange's equations,
and find the frequency of small oscillations
FIG.9.2
of the pendulum.
Solution. We shall use as generalized coordinates for this problem
the angle 4 of the pendulum with the vertical, and the horizontal

ADVANCED METHODS I N DYNAMICS

300

displacement x of the point of support. The velocity of the mass m
in terms of these coordinates can be found by combining the two
velocity components x and 1$ by the cosine law, the angle between
these velocity component vectors being 4. The kinetic energy of
the mass is thus given by:

Since this is a conservative system, the forces can be determined from
the potential energy, or they can be determined directly from the
basic definition of the generalized force. Lagrange's equations can
thus be used either in the form of Equation (9.8) or of Equation
(9.10). We shall use in this example both methods for purposes of
comparison.
The potential energy of the system may be computed, from its
basic definition, as the negative of the work done by the forces of the
system as the coordinates are increased from zero to general positive
values.
For the spring:

For the pendulum, taking h as a vertical displacement:
vp

= - l ( 1 - cos n

( - mg) dh = mgl(1 - cos 4)

thus the total potential energy is
V

=

+kx2 + mgl(1 - cos 4)

To find the generalized force Q,, imagine that the spring is stretched
a positive amount x, and consider the work done by all of the forces
of the system during an additional displacement 6x. The gravity
force on the pendulum, mg, does no work, and the spring force does
the work ( - kx)6x. Equating the total work to Q,Sx we obtain:

Similarly, to find Q,+,start the pendulum at some positive angle 4
and increase this angle by an amount 64. During this increase the

LAGRANGE'S EQUATIONS FOR A PARTICLE

301

spring force does no work, but the gravity force mg is raised by an
amount Ah, as shown in Fig. 9.3.
Therefore :
Qd84 = - mgAh
but :
Ah = 1(8$) sin C+
so :
Q48Q = - rngl sin $84
and :
Qd = - rngl sin 4
We may check these expressions for the generalized forces by deriving them from the potential
energy :

ADVANCED METHODS IN DYNAMICS

A general solution of these two simultaneous non-linear differential
equations would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. I n practice,
solutions would be calculated by numerical techniques. If we limit
ourselves to small oscillations of the system, however, the equations
become linear, and a solution can easily be obtained. Setting
sin 4 x 4, cos 4 x 1 and neglecting terms of higher than second
order in displacements or velocities, the two differential equations
become :

mx

+ ml4 + kx

0

Subtracting these two equations, we obtain:

Eliminating the 1 from the second equation by means of this expression gives:

Thus the pendulum executes small sinusoidal oscillations of
frequency :

If the point of support of the pendulum is fixed, k = cx, and the
frequency reduces to the known value for a simple pendulum.

9.5. A particle of mass m is supported by a frictionless horizontal disk
which rotates about a vertical axis through its center with a constant
angular velocity w . The particle is connected by a massless string of
length 1 to a point located a distance a from the center of the disk. Show
that the motion of the particle with respect to the disk is similar to that
of a simple pendulum, and find the frequency of small oscillations of the
system. Set up the equations in this problem by means of Lagrange's
equations.

9.3 Lagrange's Equations for a System of Particles. The
methods of the preceding section, which lead to Lagrange's equations
for a single particle, can be extended directly to a system of particles.
There will be (ql,qa, . . . q n ) independent coordinates required, where
n is the number of degrees of freedom of the system. The derivation
follows the same lines as for the single particle, except t h a t the
equations must now be summed over all of the particles of the
system. Thus, equation (9.4) becomes:

3 04

ADVANCED METHODS I N DYNAMICS

the total kinetic energy of the system becomes:

.,

and as in the preceding section, we obtain the result:

and the number of equations obtained will just be equal to the
number of degrees of freedom of the system.
The total kinetic energy T can be computed by any means appropriate to the type of system involved. For rigid bodies, Equation
(9.13) has already been evaluated in terms of the moments and
products of inertia of the body, as in Equations (7.19) and (7.20) of
Chapter 7 , and can be introduced into Lagrange's equations in that
form.
The following advantages of Lagrange's equations as compared
with some of the methods used in preceding chapters may be noted:

(1) The equations of motion are derived in the same way for
any set of coordinates. For each problem the most
suitable set of coordinates can thus be selected, without altering the basic methods used.
(2) Since the kinetic energy involves velocities only, accelerations do not have to be determined. This considerably
simplifies the kinematics part of many problems.
Since the velocities occur in squared terms, some
possible difficulties with algebraic signs are avoided.
(3) The required number of equations of motion are automatically obtained.
Some of these advantages are simply the basic advantages of the
energy method, and Lagrange's equations may be thought of as
perhaps the most general and the most useful expression of the energy
principle.
EXAMPLE1. A rigid body rotates about a fixed axis under the
action of a torque M t . Find the equation of motion of the body by
means of Lagrange's equations.
Solution. The position of the rotating body can be completely

specified by one angle 4, which we shall take as the coordinate for
this one degree of freedom system. The kinetic energy of the body
is T = $142 where I is the moment of inertia of the body about the
axis of rotation. The work done by the torque Mt as the coordinate
is changed by an amount S+ is M&, therefore the generalized force
Qd = Mt. Then:

Note that since we are measuring the coordinates from the position
of static equilibrium there are initial forces mg in the springs, which
lead to terms in the potential energy expressions for the springs which
cancel the potential energy change of the mass due to the gravity
force (See Example 1, Section 3.6.) The kinetic energy of the
system is:

shown in the figure. Derive the equations of motion of the system, using
Lagrange's equations, and find the natural period of the motion.
9.10. A rope of negligible mass passes over a fixed pulley of moment of

rope, and the other end is fixed, with the rope
sections vertical as shown. Assuming no slipping of the rope on the pulleys, find by means
of Lagrange's equations the differential equation
describing the motion of the mass ms, as the
system moves under the action of gravity.
9.11. The string of a simple pendulum is
assumed to be elastic with a spring constant k,

9.4 Oscillations of Two Degree of Freedom Systems. Consider a conservative system consisting of two equal masses m and

OSCILLATIONS OF 2 DEGREE OF FREEDOM SYSTEMS 309

three equal springs of spring constant k connected as shown in Fig.
9.5. This is the simplest type of system which illustrates the new
features which appear in a vibration problem when more than one
degree of freedom is present. Taking x l and x2, the displacements
of the two masses from the equilibrium position, as the coordinates,
we have :
T = +m(d12 + x 2 2 )
V = + k ~ l 2+ + k ( x l - X Z ) ~+ + k ~ z 2
=

+ k ~ 2 2- ~

k~12

X ~ X Z

Substituting these expressions into Lagrange's equations, we obtain
the two simultaneous differential equations of motion :

Each of these equations involves both x l and x2. Since a displacement of x l changes the force applied to the x2 mass, such coordinates
are said to be statically coupled.

310

ADVANCED METHODS IN DYNAMICS

From the form of the equations, and from the nature of the
physical problem, we expect the oscillations of the system to be
harmonic, i.e., a solution of the form sin o t or cos wt should be
suitable. We shall thus take as trial solution:

xl

=

-41 sin

wt

xe = A2 sin wt

and we shall see, by direct substitution in the equations of motion,
whether we can make this form, involving two constants and a
common frequency, satisfy all of the conditions of the problem.
Substituting these assumed solutions into the differential equation
and cancelling common factors, we obtain:

Each of these equations gives a value for the ratio A l / A z ; equating
these ratios gives:

This is the frequency equation which determines the proper values of
w . The equation is quadratic in w2 and has two roots giving the
frequencies:

The frequency equation can also be obtained by noting that since
the two simultaneous algebraic equations in A1 and A2 are homo-

OSCILLATIONS OF 2 DEGREE OF FREEDOM SYSTEMS 311

geneous, they can have a solution other than zero only if the determinant formed from the coefficients of the A's disappears:

This, of course, gives the same frequency equation.
To find the configuration of the system corresponding to the two
natural frequencies of vibration found above, we solve for the ratio
Az

from either of the algebraic equations; for example:

k

Substituting wlZ = -, we obtain:
m

hence, the two masses move in phase with equal amplitudes.
k
stituting wz2 = 3 - we obtain:
m

Sub-

and the two masses move with equal amplitudes but in opposite
directions, that is, with a 180" phase difference.
The physical significance of these two motions can easily be seen.
If A1 = A2 the two masses move together with equal amplitudes
and the center spring connecting them is neither extended nor
compressed; hence it cannot affect the motion. The frequency of
vibration should thus be the same as for one of the masses restrained
k
For the motion in which
by only one of the springs, that is, w2 =

-.m

the two masses always move in opposite directions, we note that the

ADVANCED METHODS I N DYNAMICS

312

displacements are symmetrical and that the center point of the center
spring can be considered as fixed. We can thus represent the
system as shown in Fig. 9.6, which is a single degree of freedom
system having a spring constant of k + 2k = 3k and hence a frequency

The above analysis started with the assumption that the solution
was of the form x = A sin wt. We could just as well have started

with a solution of the form x = A cos wt, in which case the same
algebraic equations for the A's would have been obtained. Since
both sine and cosine terms will satisfy the original equations, and
since superposition of solutions will be valid for the linear differential
equations involved, the general solution can be made up of a sum of
sines and cosines as:

xi
Xz

+ A I ( ~sin) w2t + B 1 ( l )cos wit + B 1 ( 2 )cos w2t
= A 2 ( l ) sin w ~ +
t A Z ( ~sin) w2t + Bz(1)cos wlt + B2(2) cos 0 2 t
=

A l ( l )sin wlt

where the subscripts on the A's and B's refer to the coordinates, and
the superscripts refer to the frequencies. We have already seen that
the A's and hence the B's, which must satisfy the same equations
as the A's, are not arbitrary, but must satisfy the conditions:

PRINCIPAL MODES OF VIBRATION

313

so the general solution becomes:

x2

=

Alcl) sin wlt - A I ( ~sin
) wet

+ Bl(1)cos wlt - B1(2)cos w2t

We thus have four arbitrary constants A l ( l ) ,A I W , B 1 ( l )and Bl(2)
which will suffice to specify the two initial displacements and the two
initial velocities for the two masses. The most general motion of the
system can thus be thought of as a superposition of the motions
corresponding to the two natural frequencies.
9.5 Principal Modes of Vibration. The two configurations in
the preceding section which correspond to motions having the two
natural frequencies of vibration of the system, are called the two
natural modes of vibration. In general, by the word "mode" we
refer to a motion of the system that can be described by a single
frequency. We have seen that the solution of the preceding problem
is a superposition of two modes of vibration, each having its characteristic frequency. There is often a decided advantage in choosing
for the system that set of coordinates for which each coordinate has
only one frequency. In the present problem this can be done by
introducing the new coordinates [I and (2, defined as :

If we write the general solution for xl and xs, as obtained in the
preceding section, in terms of these new coordinates, we obtain:

and each coordinate involves only one frequency and one mode of
vibration. Coordinates which have this property are called normal
coordinates, and the modes of vibration corresponding to them are
called the principal modes, or the normal modes of the system.
Once the normal coordinates of a system have been determined,
the problem has been essentially reduced to a study of a set of independent single degree of freedom systems. This can be illustrated

314

ADVANCED METHODS I N DYNAMICS

by the system of Fig. 9.5 with a force F = FOsin ot applied to the
left mass, as shown in Fig. 9.7. Since we have already seen that the
coordinates ( I , ( 2 describe the principal modes of the system, we shall
use these normal coordinates as the generalized coordinates for the
forced oscillation problem. Substituting xl = + 6 2 ; x 2 = 6 1 - 6 2

in the equation for kinetic and potential energy of the preceding
section, we obtain:

+
v = k(Ei2 + 3 ( z 2 )
T

= m(k12

$22)

To find the generalized force Q associated with the applied external
force F, we note that the work done by F during the displacement
6x1 = 651
8 6 2 is:

+

from which we see that:
Q1 =

F,

Q2 =

F

Lagrange's equations are now used in the form:

Note that some of the forces acting on the masses have been included
in the potential energy, while some have been left as generalized
forces. This is often a convenient procedure in problems in which
the forces fall naturally into two different categories as in the above
example. I t is necessary, however, to be careful that all of the forces
are included, and that no forces are included twice.

PRINCIPAL MODES O F VIBRATION

315

Substituting the expressions for T, V and Q into Lagrange's
equations, we obtain :

m%z

+ 3k&

=

Fo sin

mt

These are two independent equations, each involving only one
unknown, which describe the forced oscillations of the system.
They are equations of the same type as those discussed in Chapter 5,
so that the conclusions reached in that chapter as to the behavior
of a single degree of freedom system can be applied directly to the
motion of the present two degree of freedom system. I t should be
noted that any coordinate system for which the expressions for the
kinetic and potential energies are sums of squares and do not involve
cross-product terms will lead directly to a set of independent
equations of motion. One of the ways in which the normal coordinates of a system can be found is to determine the transformation
of coordinates required to make the cross-product terms in the kinetic
and potential energies disappear simultaneously. In the above
example we were able to determine the normal coordinates by inspection, because of the simplicity of the system and the symmetry
involved. In most problems this is not possible, and the normal
coordinates must be determined from the natural mode shapes, as
calculated for the free vibration problem.
In the next section we shall show how the theory of theabove
section can be extended to include a wide class of vibration problems
of any number of degrees of freedom. The fact that linear vibration
problems of any complexity can be considered as a number of superimposed single degree of freedom systems makes it possible to apply
the theory of Chapter 5 directly to the more complex systems, and
provides an additional justification for a detailed study of the single
degree of freedom system.

9.6 Small Oscillations of a Conservative System. In the preceding sections and in Chapter 5 a number of vibration problems of
various kinds have been discussed, and many common features have
been noted in the behavior of systems that were physically quite

3 20

ADVANCED METHODS I N DYNAMICS

dissimilar. We shall now show that a more general approach to the
vibration problem can be made, and that many of the characteristics
of vibrating systems can be derived in general terms that can be
applied to a large variety of physical situations.
We shall limit the present discussion to systems in which there are
no energy dissipations, and for which the forces can be derived from
a potential energy function. I t will further be supposed that the
displacements and velocities of the system are small, so that higher
order terms in these quantities can be dropped. This assumption
of small oscillations will usually result in a set of linear differential
equations, for which solutions can readily be obtained. We will
consider an n degree of freedom system having the generalized
coordinates (91~92,. . . qn),which are defined in such a way that they
all have zero values a t a position of stable equilibrium of the system.
9.7 The Potential Energy Function. The potential energy V
will be a function of the generalized coordinates (ql, 92, . . q,)
Expanding this function in a Taylor series about the position of
static equilibrium we obtain :

.

+ higher order terms
where the derivatives are all evaluated at the origin. If we define
the potential energy of the system as zero at the origin, V O= 0.
Since the system is in static equilibrium at the origin, the sum of the
forces on the system vanishes at the origin, thus :

Also, by virtue of the assumption of small oscillations, terms of
higher order than the second can be dropped, as being small

T H E KINETIC ENERGY FUNCTION

compared to the second order terms. The expression for V thus
becomes :

Since -= - the term involving the mixed derivative can

be written :

All the terms in the expression for V will thus have the same form,
and a summation convention can be used as follows:

The derivatives in this expression, since they are all evaluated a t the
origin, are constants, which we may write in the form:

and we have finally for the potential energy:

The terms k2j may be called the generalized spring constants for
the system. In some simple systems these k's will be the same as
the familiar spring constants of a spring element, but more generally
they are combinations of such spring constants, and may relate to
torsional restoring forces, gravitational restoring forces, etc.

In general, the coefficients mtj are not constants, but are functions of
the coordinates. If a typical mil be expanded in a Taylor series about
the origin, we obtain :

We shall now make use of one of our basic assumptions that the
velocities (dl, q2, . . . qn) remain small. If any of the terms in the
above series expansion for mtj beyond the constant term ( m t j ) ~
were to be retained, the expression for T would have third order
terms in it, since the mtj is multiplied by (jagj). We thus see that
for small oscillation problems the mi, terms are constant, and we

The constants mif are called the inertia constants of the system.
For simple systems they may be simple masses or moments of inertia,
but more commonly they are combinations of such quantities
depending on the coordinate system used.
It will be noted that both the potential energy and the kinetic
energy are similar quadratic forms. This fact has made it possible
to apply directly to small oscillation problems many of the mathematical techniques which have been developed for the study of
quadratic forms.
9.9 The General Equations of Free Oscillations. Since the
kinetic energy expression, Equation (9.16), does not involve the q's
aT
directly, but only the q's, the term - in Lagrange's equations will
vanish, and we have:

ADVANCED METHODS I N DYNAMICS

The terms involving the ktj cross-products are referred to as the
static coupling terms, and those containing the mrj cross-products as
dynamic coupling terms. Note that the word "coupling" refers to
the coordinates and not to the systems, so that the kinds of coupling
present depend upon the coordinates chosen rather than upon the
characteristics of the system itself. I t can be shown in general that
it is always possible to choose the generalized coordinates in such a
way that all the static coupling terms, or all the dynamic coupling
terms, or all the static and dynamic coupling terms together, will be
zero.
We shall suppose, in the following sections, that the coordinates
have been selected in such a way that all of the dynamic coupling
terms are zero. This simplification is for convenience only, and does
not represent any limitation of the basic theory.
The expression for the kinetic and potential energies for this
statically coupled system are:

where we no longer need a double subscript for the mtj terms, since
there are no cross-product terms. Substituting these expressions
for T and V into Lagrange's equations, Equation (9.17) above, we

THE GENERAL EQUATIONS O F FREE OSCILLATIONS

325

Substituting Equation (9.19) into Equations (9.18), we obtain the
following set of algebraic equations:

This set of homogeneous simultaneous equations will have a nontrivial solution only if the determinant of the coefficients vanishes:

This determinant is the frequency equation, from which the natural
frequencies of free vibration, w,, can be determined if the k's and
m's for the system are known. This frequency equation will give n
values of w2 from which the n positive real values, (wl, w2, . .
w, . . . wn) can be determined.
Corresponding to each natural frequency w, will be a set of A
values (Alc'), A2('), A3('), . . . An(')) which will describe the configuration of the system as it vibrates harmonically with the frequency w,. Such a set of A(r)'s defines the shape of a @inci$al mode
of oscillation of the system. Note that the values of the A's are
not determined; it is only the ratios between the A's, that is, the
"shape" of the mode, that can be determined from the set of homogeneous Equations (9.20). Physically this means that while the
shape of the harmonic mode is fixed, its absolute amplitude can have
any value, so long as it remains small. The notation that is used for
the A's should be carefully considered; note that the subscript refers
to the coordinate, while the superscript in parentheses refers to
the mode of vibration. On the other hand, for the frequency a ,
which involves the mode only, and not the individual coordinates, it
is more convenient to use the single subscript referring to the mode,
as w,.

The general solution of the set of simultaneous differential
equations of motion Equation (9.18) can be obtained by a superposition of the solutions corresponding to the principal modes:

A similar expression involving a cos wrt instead of the sin w,t could
be added if necessary to satisfy the initial conditions of a particular
problem.
9.10 Orthogonality of the Principal Modes. In the present
section a basic property of the principal modes of vibration will be
developed which will be of considerable use for the calculation of
natural frequencies and mode shapes, as well as for further extensions
of the theory.
Consider two particular principal oscillations having different frequencies w , and w,. From Equations (9.20) we may write:

where each equation is of the form:

Multiply the first equation by A ~ ( s )and
,
the second equation by
A&'), obtaining :

each of these equations is a set of (i = 1, 2, 3, . . . n) equations;
adding this system of equations term by term on each side, we obtain:

In the left side of the second equation the subscript i may be written
as j and the subscript j may be written as i without affecting the

NATURAL FREQUENCIES AND MODE SHAPES

327

value of the term, since krj = kjc and in each case we are only
summing from 1 to n on the subscripts. We thus see that the left
sides of the two equations are identical and hence if the second is
subtracted from the first there results:

Since we have picked

w,

# us,
we have, finally:

This equation is called the orthogonality relation. The reason for
this name may be seen by considering two vectors a and b which are
perpendicular, or orthogonal, to each other. The analytical condition for this orthogonality is a * b = 0, or:

Thus, Equation (9.24) may be thought of as the condition that two
n-dimensional vectors m*A (s) and m*A(r) are orthogonal.
9.11 Example: The @alculationof Natural Frequencies and
Mode Shapes. As an illustration of the above general theory, we
shall work out a particular example. Three equal masses slide

without friction on a horizontal plane. They are connected together
by three equal springs of spring constant k as shown in Fig. 9.8.
Find the natural frequencies and mode shapes for this system.
Solution. Take as coordinates the three absolute displacements
of the masses, X I , x z , and x3. Then, in terms of these coordinates:

ADVANCED METHODS I N DYNAMICS

Thus, in this particular problem, we have a statically coupled set of
coordinates, with :

Substituting these values into Equation (9.20) we obtain:
(2k - mw2)Al - kA2 = 0
- k A i 4 (2k - mw2)Az - k A 3 = 0
- k A z + (k - mwZ)A3 = 0
or, putting

The frequency determinant, Equation (9.2l), becomes :

Expanding the determinant, we obtain the following polynomial
equation for f :
f3 - 5 f 2 + 6 f - 1 = 0
from which :
f i = 0.198; j 2 = 1.555; f3 = 3.247
Thus, the three natural frequencies of vibration are:

We find the mode shapes from the three algebraic equations
for Al, A z , A 3 in terms of the f. Since it is only the ratios between

NATURAL FREQUENCIES AND MODE SHAPES

329

the A's that can be determined, we can arbitrarily set A1 = 1 for
each of the modes, so that we can work with numbers; then:

For the first mode, for which f l = 0.198

For the second mode, fa = 1.555

L

Equilibrium position

First mode

Second mode

Third mode

For the third mode, f3 = 3.247

Thus, in the lowest mode of vibration the three masses always
move in the same direction, with ma having 2.245 times the amplitude of ml, and mz having 1.802 times the amplitude of ml. I n the
second mode, ml and ma move in the same direction, while m3
moves in the opposite direction, and in the third mode ml and ma
move in the same direction while ma moves in the opposite direction.
The configuration of the system as it vibrates in each of the principal
modes of vibration can be indicated diagrammatically as in Figure 9.9.

9.12 Forced Oscillations. We shall now suppose that the
statically coupled conservative system which has been considered
above is acted upon by a system of periodic exciting forces Fz sin wt
so that the basic equations of motion become :

$(%) +

=

F , sin

wt

Following the same procedure that was successful for the single
degree of freedom system of Chapter 5, we shall assume that the
steady state solution will be harmonic and of the same frequency as
the exciting force, In what follows we shall consider steady state
motion only. We suppose that there is a small amount of damping
present which after a time will eliminate the transient terms, but
which is not large enough to change appreciably the steady state
forced amplitudes.
It cannot be expected that the solution will involve only a single
mode of vibration, since all of the modes may be excited simultaneously. We accordingly write a trial solution in the form :

where the coefficients c z ( r ) are the steady state amplitudes of the
forced oscillations of the various modes. We do not need to include
a phase angle in this expression, since for the undamped system the
phase shift will be either zero or 180".
Substituting the general expressions for kinetic and potential
energies into Equation (9.25) we obtain:

Putting Equation (9.26) into this equation, and cancelling the
common sin wt term leads to:

FORCED OSCILLATIONS

'

333

The next step will consist of expressing the coefficients ct(r) in
terms of the mode shape numbers Ar(r) that have been defined above
in connection with the free oscillation problem. We define a new
coefficient, a @ )as:

The physical significance of Equation (9.28) is that we suppose each
mode excited by the external forces to have the same shape as the
free oscillation mode, with an amplitude a(r) that remains to be
determined.
Substituting Equation (9.28) into Equation (9.27), we find that
the second term becomes:

We now refer back to Equation (9.23), which states that:

Introducing this into the last expression above, we can write Equation
(9.27) as:

334

ADVANCED METHODS I N DYNAMICS

Note that for the single degree of freedom case Equation (9.29)
reduces to the form :

which checks the conclusions reached in Chapter 5 for the steady state
amplitude of the single degree of freedom system with no damping.
For the multiple degree of freedom system this calculation is not so
simple, because the amplitude coefficients a(r) occur in Equation
(9.29) as the coefficients in a series. These constants can be determined, however, by expanding the exciting forces Fr into a series of
the same normal functions A t @ ) that appear with the amplitude
coefficients. We will thus write the exciting force as:

where we use j instead of i to indicate that such an expansion could
be applied in general to any one of the forces. This process of
expanding the function F5 into a series is similar in principle to the
expansion of a function in a Fourier series, but instead of sines and
cosines we use the functions A+r) because of their appropriateness to
the particular problem involved. The method of determining the
unknown coefficients is analogous to that used for the Fourier
coefficients.
Writing several terms of Equations (9.30) gives:

Multiply both sides of this equation by Ar(r),and thus obtain:

Summing over both sides of this set of n equations gives:

FORCED OSCILLATIONS

where r # s. The second term on the right becomes:

but by the orthogonality relation of Equation (9.24) :

and hence the only term left on the right is the single term involving
f ( r ) , and we find :

Substituting Equations (9.31) and (9.30) into Equation (9.29) will
then give the amplitude coefficients a @ :)

The final solution for the steady state vibrations is then given by
Equation (9.28) and (9.26):

sin

As a specific example illustrating the use of Equation (9.33) consider
the system of three masses of Figure 9.8. Suppose that a force
F sin at acts on the middle mass m2, and that we are to determine

the steady state motion of the first mass m l . Using Equation (9.33)
we first substitute i = 1, since we wish the motion of the first mass:

We then expand the r-summation, and obtain the three terms:

We next expand the j-summations, noting that

9.13 The Calculus of Variations. Many problems of classical
mechanics are most naturally formulated in terms of maximum or
minimum statements. Consider, for example, the famous problem
of the Brachistochrone, as formulated b y John Bernoulli in 1696.

338

ADVANCED METHODS IN DYNAMICS

"A particle, under the action of gravity, slides along a smooth curve
which lies in a vertical plane. Find the form of the curve for which
the time required for the particle to move between two given points
on the curve is a minimum." As a second example, consider the
statics problem of the determination of the equilibrium form of a
flexible chain, supported a t its ends and hanging in a vertical plane.
This problem can be solved by finding the shape of the chain which
makes the potential energy of the system a minimum.
Such problems have aroused the interest of some of the greatest
investigators. The Brachistochrone problem was first solved
independently by John Bernoulli, Newton,
and Leibnitz and the development of the basic
A
theory of such problems was carried out by
Euler and Lagrange. An idea of the fundamental mathematical problem may be obtained
y " f ( ~ ) from the analytical statement of the Brachistochrone problem. In Fig. 9.10, the particle
of mass m slides down the vertical curve AB
Y
under the action of the gravity force mg, and
we wish to determine the shape of the curve
FIG.9.10
y = f ( x ) such that the time from A to B is a
minimum. The time required by the particle to travel an arc length
ds is dslv, and thus the total time from A to B is:

From the energy principle, the velocity of the particle will depend
upon the vertical distance traveled :

we also have ds

=

[1 + B)'1 ' dx and hence the final expression

for the time becomes:

We thus see that the problem requires the minimization of a definite

EULER'S DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION

339

integral by means of a change in the form of the integrand function.
We may now compare this problem with the type of minimum and
maximum problem with which we are already familiar.
I n ordinary maximum and minimum problems, we are generally
given a function of several variables in the form:

and we wish to find the values of the x's for which the function has an
extreme value. The necessary conditions for the solution of this
problem are given by the equations:

In the calculus of variations we also have the problem of finding an
extremum, but now the expression to be investigated no longer
depends upon a finite number of independent variables, but depends
instead upon the behavior of one or more dependent variables. The
particular expression of this type with which we shall be concerned
has the form:

I

=

Ixa

/ (x,y,

Xl

$) dx,

where y

=

C(x)

(9.34)

Given the function f we are to determine the function t$ which will
give I a stationary value. I t will be observed that the analytical
expression for the Brachistochrone problem is a special case of
Equation (9.34).
The solution of this mathematical problem will not only enable us
to solve many specific problems, but will also permit us to put the
basic equations of motion into several new forms, which have been
of great importance in the development of advanced dynamics.
9.14 Euler's Differential Equation. The basic solution of the
problem defined in Equation (9.34) is given by Euler's Differential
Equation, which we shall derive by a method similar to that employed
by Lagrange. Given the definite integral I

ADVANCED METHODS IN DYNAMICS

Referring to Fig. 9.11, we note that if the curve shown there as a
solid line is actually the correct +(x) to give the minimum value to I,
then the integral evaluated over some slightly different curve, such
as the dotted curve, will have a slightly larger value. This slightly
different curve, which has the same end points A and B as the exact
curve, is called the varied path. If we imagine that at a particular
value of the independent variable x we move to the varied curve, the
ordinate of the varied curve a t that point will be y + Sy which can
be written as:

y

+ sy = + ( X I +

E~(x)

(9.35)

where Sy is called the variation in y
and the small quantity E indicates
that the varied path is slightly
different from the minimum path.
We use the variation symbol S to
A
distinguish Sy from the differential
dy. Note that dy is the infinitesimal
Y
x
change in the given function $(x)
FIG.9.11
caused by an infinitesimal change dx
in the independent variable x, whereas Sy is a small arbitrary change
in y equal to &(x).
As the path in Fig. 9.11 is changed from the original to the varied
path, the value of the integral I will change by a small amount
61, called the variation of the integral. If F(y,y', x) is the modified
integrand corresponding t o the varied path, we have :
B

and we see that the processes of variation and integration can be
interchanged.
We next consider the way in which f (y,y', x ) varies as we go from
the original to the varied path. At one particular value of x, y
will change to y + 6y, and the slope will change from y' to y' -I- Sy',
thus :

,

EULER'S DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION

The slope of the varied curve is

and thus 6y'

= y'

d
+(6y) - y '
dx

=

- (6y), which indicates that the
dx

processes of variation and differentiation can be interchanged. Equation (9.37) can now be written as:

which, when introduced into equation (9.36) gives:

Integrating by parts the second term in this integral, we obtain:

Since the varied curve coincides with the exact curve at the endpoints A and B, 6y = 0 at A and B and the term

Thus Equation (9.38) becomes :

For a stationary value of I , 6 I = 0. Since 6y is arbitrary and can
be taken as different from zero, 61 can be zero only if the expression
in the square brackets is zero:

This is Euler's Differential Equation, and the function y = +(x)
which satisfies this equation is the desired function which will give

of the point P which traces out the cycloid are :

If we put 2c2gr = 4,this equation is identically satisfied, so that the
Brachistochrone is a cycloid of radius r = 1/4c2g.
It should be noted that in some problems a simplification can be
introduced by an interchange of the independent and dependent
variables. I n the above example of the Brachistochrone, suppose
that we take y as the independent variable and x as the dependent
variable so that the integral becomes:

9.15 Hamilton's Principle. I t will be observed that Euler's
Differential equation (9.39) which is the condition for minimizing
a certain integral, has the same form as Lagrange's equations of
motion. Writing Lagrange's equations for a conservative system
in the form:

we see from Equation (9.39) that an equivalent statement is:

Equation (9.40) is an analytical statement of Hamilton's Principle,
which says that the actual path followed by a dynamical process is
such as to make the integral of the function (T - V) a minimum.
For most problems of the type hitherto considered in this book,
Hamilton's Principle does not lead to any particular advantage in the
setting up of the equations of motion, since it is equivalent in such
applications to the use of Lagrange's equations, as is shown in
Example 1 below. Hamilton's Principle does have important
engineering applications, however, in the setting up of the partial
differential equations of motion describing infinite degree of freedom
systems. In such problems as the vibrations of beams, Hamilton's
Principle plays the same role in establishing the equations of motion
that was played by Lagrange's equations for the finite degree of
freedom systems. Typical examples of this use of Hamilton's
Principle are given below in Example 2 and in the problems.

For problems of this kind it will be noted that Hamilton's Principle
leads to exactly the same steps as the use of Lagrange's equations.

Instead of applying Euler's differential equation to this problem, we
shall go through the steps which lead to Euler's equation. I n many
problems this procedure will be more suitable than a direct substitution into Euler's equation.
Performing the variation as indicated, we obtain:

writing 6y

- (6y) we have :
ax2

Integrate the first term by parts, as follows:

Since by the definition of the varied path, 6y = 0 a t the two endpoints tl and tz, the first part disappears.
We next integrate the second term in the integral by parts twice,
as follows:

In this expression, the first term is zero, since a t both 0 and 1 the
bending moment in the beam, which is proportional to y", is zero,
because the beam is supported by frictionless pins a t the ends.
The second term is zero since 6y is zero a t the two ends of the beam.
Thus, the variational equation becomes :

ADVANCED METHODS IN DYNAMICS

Since 6y is arbitrary, and can be taken as different from zero, the
condition that the integral should vanish requires that the term in
the parentheses should be zero. This gives the required partial
differential equation of vibration of the beam:

Note that the above variational procedure not only developed the
differential equation, but that the boundary conditions as well
were automatically involved.

ADVANCED METHODS I N DYNAMICS

9.16 Hamilton's Canonical Equations of Motion. For
engineering applications of dynamics, Lagrange's equations in the
form of Equation (9.14) or Hamilton's Principle in the form of
Equation (9.40) are usually the most convenient formulation of the
basic laws of motion. For certain applications in physics, however,
other forms of these basic principles are often used. We shall
briefly indicate the way in which some of these alternative statements are made.
We start with Lagrange's equations for a conservative system in
the form : [Equation (9.11).]

Introduce the definition

er

=

aL
- = generalized momentum.
842

(9.41)

In terms of pi, Equation (9.11) becomes:

A new function H, the Hamiltonian Function, is now defined as:

In general, the Lagrangian function L is a function of qi, qt, and t ;
L(qt, qr, t). The qt enters through the kinetic energy as a quadratic
term, and thus Equation (9.41) above will give pi as a linear function
of qt. This set of linear equations involving Pi and qt could in theory
be solved giving qi in terms of pi, and hence the qa's could in principle
always be eliminated from Equation (9.43). We may thus say that
H can always be expressed as a function of pi, qi, and t,
H

=

H(ptl qi, t)

(9.44)

We shall now express the differential of H in two ways, first by
differentiating Equation (9.43))and then by differentiating Equation
(9.44).
From equation (9.43) :

HAMILTON'S CANONICAL EQUATIONS OF MOTION

353

By virtue of Equation (9.41), the first and the fourth terms in this
expression cancel, so :

From Equation (9.44):

Equations (9.45) and (9.46) must be equal for all values of the
variables, so the coefficients of the corresponding differentials can
be equated, thus:

aL
By Equation (9.42) - = p i , so we can write:
846

Equations (9.48)are called Hamilton's Canonical Equations of Motion.

PROBLEMS
9.46. Show that for a conservative system the expression for Hamilton's
Principle can be written as:

where E is the total energy. Show that in this form Hamilton's Principle
is equivalent to finding the extreme value of the integral:

This integral is called the action integral, and the above statements express
what is often called the principle of least action.
9.47. Show that if the Lagrangian function L is not a function of time,
the Hamiltonian function H is constant.

of a particle:

where :

show that the kinetic energy can be written as:

I t may be noted that since T is a homogeneous quadratic function of the
q's, this result also follows directly from Euler's theorem for homogeneous
functions.
(b) Combining Equations (9.41) and (9.43) above, one obtains

H=

H is equal to the total energy of the system.

Appendix II
UNITS OF MASS AND FORCE
In principle a single unit of mass with its corresponding unit of force
is sufficient for all purposes. In practice, however, a number of different
units may be encountered. Since units are often used without a specific
statement as to their definition, misunderstandings may result.
Perhaps the greatest source of difficulty is associated with the fact
that the same name "pound" is given both to a unit of force and to a
unit of mass. I t is customary among engineers to use the name "pound,"
without qualification, for a force. On the other hand, the only legal
definitions existing in the United States define the pound as the unit of
mass. The engineer should thus understand that any "standard weight "
calibrated by the U. S. Bureau of Standards will be essentially a standard
of mass, and that any measurement of the weight of a body, which is
made by means of a balance or spring which has been calibrated by such
a "standard weight" will be actually a measure of the mass of the body.
The possible error due to a confusion of the two units might seem to be
negligible, since the variation of the acceleration of gravity is small. I t
is conceivable, however, that this error might be of concern in the
calibration of high-precision testing machines or in the weighing of' very
expensive materials. I t should be understood that the statement that
one pound-mass has a weight of one pound-force is only approximate,
and the fact that the error involved is small should not be permitted to
obscure the fundamental difference between the concepts of force and
mass.
The following definitions will indicate the precise meanings which are
to be attached to the various common terms.

Units of Mass
Standard Kilogram (kg)-The international standard of mass. The
mass of a particular body in the possession of the International
Committee of Weights and Measures in France.
Gram (g)--One one-thousandth part of the standard kilogram.
Pound, or Pound-Mass (U. S. Avoirdupois) (lb, lb-m.)-Legally defined as -part of the standard kilogram. The U. S. Bureau
2.2046
of Standards at present uses a more accurate definition which states
that the pound is equal to 453.5924277 g.
357

358

APPENDIX I1

British Imperial Pound-The mass of a platinum cylinder kept in the
Standard's Ofice, England. The legal equivalent is 453.59243 g.
Hence it may be considered as practically equivalent to the U. S.
Standard Avoirdupois Pound.
Slug, or Geepound-A unit of mass having a magnitude such that a
force of 1 Ib applied to a body having a mass of 1 slug would result
in an acceleration of 1 fdsec.2

Units of Force
Pound, Pound-Force, Pound-Weight (Ib, lb-f, lb-wt)-The force required to give a mass of 1 lb an acceleration of 32.174 f t / ~ e c . ~
Poundul-The force required to give a mass of 1 Ib an acceleration of
1 ft/'~ec.~
Dyne-The force required to give a mass of 1 g an acceleration of
1cm/~ec.~
Gram-Weight-The force required to give a mass of 1 g an acceleration
~
ft/sec.2)
of 980.665 ~ m / s e c .(32.174
The names of the following quantities are frequently used incorrectly.
The definitions given are believed to represent the most commonly accepted engineering practice.
SpeciJic Weight-The weight per unit volume of a material.
SpeciJic Mass-The mass per unit volume of a material.
Density-Same as Specific Mass.
Specijic Gravity-The ratio of the specific mass of a material to the
specific mass of some standard material. Unless otherwise stated
the standard material is taken to be water a t 4" C.

Appendix III
VECTOR PRODUCTS
Two different vector products are defined and used in mechanics.
The scalar or dot product of two vectors is defined as the scalar quantity
having a magnitude equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two
vectors multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.
a . b = ab cos 0
Scalar multiplication is both commutative and distributive, that is:

Written in terms of the unit vectors i, j, k along an orthogonal coordinate
system:

a = a,i
b = b,i
a . b = a&,
since

+ a,j + a,k
+ b j + b,k
+ a,b, + a,b,

i.i=j.j=k.k= 1
2.3 = j . $ = i . k = k . i = j . k = k . j = O

.. ..

The vector or cross product of two vectors is defined as a vector whose
magnitude is given by the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors

multiplied by the sine of the angle between the two vectors. The vector
product is perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors and has

vector to the second vector.
