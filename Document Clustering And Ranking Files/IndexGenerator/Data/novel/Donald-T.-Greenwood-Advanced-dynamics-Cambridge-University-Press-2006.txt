Advanced Dynamics
Advanced Dynamics is a broad and detailed description of the analytical tools of dynamics
as used in mechanical and aerospace engineering. The strengths and weaknesses of various
approaches are discussed, and particular emphasis is placed on learning through problem
solving.
The book begins with a thorough review of vectorial dynamics and goes on to cover
Lagrange’s and Hamilton’s equations as well as less familiar topics such as impulse response,
and differential forms and integrability. Techniques are described that provide a considerable
improvement in computational ef?ciency over the standard classical methods, especially
when applied to complex dynamical systems. The treatment of numerical analysis includes
discussions of numerical stability and constraint stabilization. Many worked examples and
homework problems are provided. The book is intended for use in graduate courses on
dynamics, and will also appeal to researchers in mechanical and aerospace engineering.

Preface
This is a dynamics textbook for graduate students, written at a moderately advanced level. Its
principal aim is to present the dynamics of particles and rigid bodies in some breadth, with
examples illustrating the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods of dynamical
analysis. The scope of the dynamical theory includes both vectorial and analytical methods.
There is some emphasis on systems of great generality, that is, systems which may have
nonholonomic constraints and whose motion may be expressed in terms of quasi-velocities.
Geometrical approaches such as the use of surfaces in n-dimensional con?guration and
velocity spaces are used to illustrate the nature of holonomic and nonholonomic constraints.
Impulsive response methods are discussed at some length.
Some of the material presented here was originally included in a graduate course in
computational dynamics at the University of Michigan. The ordering of the chapters, with
the chapters on dynamical theory presented ?rst followed by the single chapter on numerical
methods, is such that the degree of emphasis one chooses to place on the latter is optional.
Numerical computation methods may be introduced at any point, or may be omitted entirely.
The ?rst chapter presents in some detail the familiar principles of Newtonian or vectorial
dynamics, including discussions of constraints, virtual work, and the use of energy and
momentum principles. There is also an introduction to less familiar topics such as differential
forms, integrability, and the basic theory of impulsive response.
Chapter 2 introduces methods of analytical dynamics as represented by Lagrange’s and
Hamilton’s equations. The derivation of these equations begins with the Lagrangian form
of d’Alembert’s principle, a common starting point for obtaining many of the principal
forms of dynamical equations of motion. There are discussions of ignorable coordinates,
the Routhian method, and the use of integrals of the motion. Frictional and gyroscopic
forces are studied, and further material is presented on impulsive systems.
Chapter 3 is concerned with the kinematics and dynamics of rigid body motion. Dyadic
and matrix notations are introduced. Euler parameters and axis-and-angle variables are
used extensively in representing rigid body orientations in addition to the more familiar
Euler angles. This chapter also includes material on constrained impulsive response and
input-output methods.
The theoretical development presented in the ?rst three chapters is used as background
for the derivations of Chapter 4. Here we present several differential methods which have the
advantages of simplicity and computational ef?ciency over the usual Lagrangian methods
x
Preface
in the analysis of general constrained systems or for systems described in terms of quasi-
velocities. These methods result in a minimum set of dynamical equations which are compu-
tationally ef?cient. Many examples are included in order to compare and explain the various
approaches. This chapter also presents detailed discussions of constraints and energy rates
by using velocity space concepts.
Chapter 5 begins with a derivation of Hamilton’s principle in its holonomic and nonholo-
nomic forms. Stationarity questions are discussed. Transpositional relations are introduced
and there follows a further discussion of integrability including Frobenius’ theorem. The
central equation and its explicit transpositional form are presented. There is a comparison
of integral methods by means of examples.
Chapter 6 presents some basic principles of numerical analysis and explains the use of
integration algorithms in the numerical solution of differential equations. For the most part,
explicit algorithms such as the Runge–Kutta and predictor–corrector methods are consid-
ered. There is an analysis of numerical stability of the integration methods, primarily by
solving the appropriate difference equations, but frequency response methods are also used.
The last portion of the chapter considers methods of representing kinematic constraints. The
one-step method of constraint stabilization is introduced and its advantages over standard
methods are explained. There is a discussion of the use of energy and momentum constraints
as a means of improving the accuracy of numerical computations.
A principal objective of this book is to improve the problem-solving skills of each student.
Problem solving should include not only a proper formulation and choice of variables, but
also a directness of approach which avoids unnecessary steps. This requires that the student
repeatedly attempt the solution of problems which may be kinematically complex and
which involve the application of several dynamical principles. The problems presented here
usually have several parts that require more than the derivation of the equations of motion
for a given system. Thus, insight is needed concerning other dynamical characteristics.
Because of the rather broad array of possible approaches presented here, and due in part to
the generally demanding problems, a conscientious student can attain a real perspective of
the subject of dynamics and a competence in the application of its principles.
Finally, I would like to acknowledge the helpful discussions with Professor J. G.
Papastavridis of Georgia Tech concerning the material of Chapters 4 and 5, and with Pro-
fessor R. M. Howe of the University of Michigan concerning portions of Chapter 6.

Introductiontoparticledynamics
In the study of dynamics at an advanced level, it is important to consider many approaches
and points of view in order that one may attain a broad theoretical perspective of the subject.
As we proceed we shall emphasize those methods which are particularly effective in the
analysis of relatively dif?cult problems in dynamics. At this point, however, it is well to
review some of the basic principles in the dynamical analysis of systems of particles. In
the process, the kinematics of particle motion will be reviewed, and many of the notational
conventions will be established.
1.1 Particle motion
The laws of motion for a particle
Let us consider Newton’s three laws of motion which were published in 1687 in his Prin-
cipia. They can be stated as follows:
I. Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless
compelled to change that state by forces acting upon it.
II. The time rate of change of linear momentum of a body is proportional to the force
acting upon it and occurs in the direction in which the force acts.
III. To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction; that is, the mutual forces of two
bodies acting upon each other are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
In the dynamical analysis of a system of particles using Newton’s laws, we can interpret
the word “body” to mean a particle, that is, a certain ?xed mass concentrated at a point.
The ?rst two of Newton’s laws, as applied to a particle, can be summarized by the law of
motion:
F= ma (1.1)
HereF is the total force applied to the particle of mass m and it includes both direct contact
forces and ?eld forces such as gravity or electromagnetic forces. The acceleration a of
the particle must be measured relative to an inertial or Newtonian frame of reference. An
example of an inertial frame is anxyz set of axes which is not rotating relative to the “?xed”
2 Introductiontoparticledynamics
stars and has its origin at the center of mass of the solar system. Any other reference frame
which is not rotating but is translating at a constant rate relative to an inertial frame is
itself an inertial frame. Thus, there are in?nitely many inertial frames, all with constant
translational velocities relative to the others. Because the relative velocities are constant,
the acceleration of a given particle is the same relative to any inertial frame. The force F
and mass m are also the same in all inertial frames, so Newton’s law of motion is identical
relative to all inertial frames.
Newton’s third law, the law of action and reaction, has a corollary assumption that the
interaction forces between any two particles are directed along the straight line connecting
the particles. Thus we have the law of action and reaction:
When two particles exert forces on each other, these interaction forces
are equal in magnitude, opposite in sense, and are directed along the
straight line joining the particles.
Thecollinearity of the interaction forces applies to all mechanical and gravitational forces.
It does not apply, however, to interactions between moving electrically charged particles for
which the interaction forces are equal and opposite but not necessarily collinear. Systems
of this sort will not be studied here.
An alternative form of the equation of motion of a particle is
F= ? p (1.2)
where the linear momentum of the particle is
p= mv (1.3)
andv is the particle velocity relative to an inertial frame.
Kinematics of particle motion
The application of Newton’s laws of motion to a particle requires that an expression can
be found for the acceleration of the particle relative to an inertial frame. For example, the
position vector of a particle relative to a ?xed Cartesian frame might be expressed as
r= xi+ yj+ zk (1.4)
where i, j, k are unit vectors, that is, vectors of unit magnitude which have the directions
of the positive x, y, and z axes, respectively. When unit vectors are used to specify a vector
in 3-space, the three unit vectors are always linearly independent and are nearly always
mutually perpendicular. The velocity of the given particle is
v= ? r= ? xi+ ? yj+ ? zk (1.5)
and its acceleration is
a= ? v= ¨ xi+ ¨ yj+ ¨ zk (1.6)
relative to the inertial frame.
3 Particlemotion
A forceF applied to the particle may be described in a similar manner.
F= F
x
i + F
y
j + F
z
k (1.7)
where (F
x
, F
y
, F
z
) are the scalar components of F. In general, the force components can
be functions of position, velocity, and time, but often they are much simpler.
If one writes Newton’s law of motion, (1.1), in terms of the Cartesian unit vectors, and
then equates the scalar coef?cients of each unit vector on the two sides of the equation, one
obtains
F
x
= m ¨ x
F
y
= m ¨ y (1.8)
F
z
= m¨ z
These three scalar equations are equivalent to the single vector equation. In general, the
scalar equations are coupled through the expressions for the force components. Further-
more, the differential equations are often nonlinear and are not susceptible to a complete
analytic solution. In this case, one can turn to numerical integration on a digital computer
to obtain the complete solution. On the other hand, one can often use energy or momen-
tum methods to obtain important characteristics of the motion without having the complete
solution.
The calculation of a particle acceleration relative to an inertial Cartesian frame is straight-
forward because the unit vectors (i,j,k) are ?xed in direction. It turns out, however, that
because of system geometry it is sometimes more convenient to use unit vectors that are
not ?xed. For example, the position, velocity, and acceleration of a particle moving along
a circular path are conveniently expressed using radial and tangential unit vectors which
change direction with position.
As a more general example, suppose that an arbitrary vectorA is given by
A= A

where the unit vectorse

This unit vector triad changes its orientation with time. It rotates as a rigid body with an
angular velocity?, where the direction of? is along the axis of rotation and the positive
sense of? is in accordance with the right-hand rule.
The ?rst time derivative ofA is

Velocity and acceleration expressions for common coordinate systems
Let us apply the general equation (1.12) to some common coordinate systems associated
with particle motion.
Cylindrical coordinates
Suppose that the position of a particle P is speci?ed by the values of its cylindrical coordi-
nates (r,?,z). We see from Fig. 1.1 that the position vectorr is
r= re
r

(1.15)

so we ?nd that ? e

(1.17)
Thus, the velocity of the particle P is
v= ? r= ? re

(1.18)
Similarly, noting that

we ?nd that its acceleration is

(1.20)
If we restrict the motion such that ? z and ¨ z are continuously equal to zero, we obtain the
velocity and acceleration equations for plane motion using polar coordinates.
Spherical coordinates
From Fig. 1.2 we see that the position of particle P is given by the spherical coordinates
(r,?,?). The position vector of the particle is simply

Tangential and normal components
Suppose a particle P moves along a given path in three-dimensional space. The position
of the particle is speci?ed by the single coordinate s, measured from some reference point
along the path, as shown in Fig. 1.3. It is convenient to use the three unit vectors (e
t

n

)
where e

Relative motion and rotating frames
When one uses Newton’s laws to describe the motion of a particle, the accelerationa must
be absolute, that is, it must be measured relative to an inertial frame. This acceleration,
of course, is the same when measured with respect to any inertial frame. Sometimes the
motion of a particle is known relative to a rotating and accelerating frame, and it is desired
to ?nd its absolute velocity and acceleration. In general, these calculations can be somewhat
complicated, but for the special case in which the moving frame A is not rotating, the results
are simple. The absolute velocity of a particle P is
v
P
= v
A
+v
P/A
(1.32)
wherev
A
is the absolute velocity of any point on frame A andv
P/A
is the velocity of particle
P relative to frame A, that is, the velocity recorded by cameras or other instruments ?xed
in frame A and moving with it. Similarly, the absolute acceleration of P is
a
P
= a
A
+a
P/A
(1.33)
where we note again that the frame A is moving in pure translation.
Now consider the general case in which the moving xyz frame (Fig. 1.4) is translating
and rotating arbitrarily. We wish to ?nd the velocity and acceleration of a particle P relative

to the inertial XYZ frame in terms of its motion with respect to the noninertial xyz frame.
Let the origin O
null of the xyz frame have a position vector R relative to the origin O of the
XYZ frame. The position of the particle P relative to O
null is?, so the position of P relative
to XYZ is
r= R+? (1.34)
The corresponding velocity is
v= ? r=
?
R+ ? ? (1.35)
Now let us use the basic equation (1.12) to express ? ? in terms of the motion relative to the
moving xyz frame. We obtain
? ?= (? ?)
r
+?×? (1.36)
where? is the angular velocity of the xyz frame and ( ? ?)
r
is the velocity of P relative to
that frame. In detail,
?= xi+ yj+ zk (1.37)
and
(? ?)
r
= ? xi+ ? yj+ ? zk (1.38)
where i,j,k are unit vectors ?xed in the xyz frame and rotating with it. From (1.35) and
(1.36), the absolute velocity of P is
v= ? r=

The expression for the inertial accelerationa of the particle is found by ?rst noting that

r

r
(1.40)
d

(?×?)= ? ?×?+?× (( ? ?)

(1.41)
Thus, we obtain the important result:
a= ? v=
¨
R+ ? ?×?+?× (?×?)+(¨ ?)
r
+ 2?×(? ?)
r
(1.42)
where ? is the angular velocity of the xyz frame. The nature of the various terms is as
follows.
¨
R is the inertial acceleration of O
null , the origin of the moving frame. The term
? ?×? might be considered as a tangential acceleration although, more accurately, it rep-
resents a changing tangential velocity?×? due to changing?. The term?× (?×?)is
a centripetal acceleration directed toward an axis of rotation through O
null . These ?rst three
terms represent the acceleration of a point coincident with P but ?xed in the xyz frame.
The ?nal two terms add the effects of motion relative to the moving frame. The term ( ¨ ?)
r
is the acceleration of P relative to the xyz frame, that is, the acceleration of the particle, as
recorded by instruments ?xed in the xyz frame and rotating with it. The ?nal term 2?×(? ?)
r
is the Coriolis acceleration due to a velocity relative to the rotating frame. Equation (1.42)
is particularly useful if the motion of the particle relative to the moving xyz frame is simple;
for example, linear motion or motion along a circular path.
Instantaneous center of rotation
If each point of a rigid body moves in planar motion, it is useful to consider a lamina,o r
slice, of the body which moves in its own plane (Fig. 1.5). If the lamina does not move in
pure translation, that is, if?null 0, then a point C exists in the lamina, or in an imaginary

10 Introductiontoparticledynamics
extension thereof, at which the velocity is momentarily zero. This is the instantaneous
center of rotation.
Suppose that arbitrary points A and B have velocities v
A
and v
B
. The instantaneous
center C is located at the intersection of the perpendicular lines tov
A
andv
B
. The velocity
of a point P with a position vector? relative to C is
v=?×? (1.43)
where? is the angular velocity vector of the lamina. Thus, if the location of the instantaneous
center is known, it is easy to ?nd the velocity of any other point of the lamina at that instant.
On the other hand, the acceleration of the instantaneous center is generally not zero. Hence,
the calculation of the acceleration of a general point in the lamina is usually not aided by a
knowledge of the instantaneous center location.
If there is planar rolling motion of one body on another ?xed body without any slipping,
the instantaneous center lies at the contact point between the two bodies. As time proceeds,
this point moves with respect to both bodies, thereby tracing a path on each body.
Example1.1 A wheel of radius r rolls in planar motion without slipping on a ?xed convex
surface of radius R (Fig. 1.6a). We wish to solve for the acceleration of the contact point
on the wheel. The contact point C is the instantaneous center, and therefore, the velocity of
the wheel’s center O
null is

Example1.2 Let us calculate the acceleration of a point P on the rim of a wheel of radius

1.2 Systems of particles
A system of particles with all its interactions constitutes a dynamical system of great gen-
erality. Consequently, it is important to understand thoroughly the principles which govern
its motions. Here we shall establish some of the basic principles. Later, these principles will
be used in the study of rigid body dynamics.
Equations of motion
Consider a system of N particles whose positions are given relative to an inertial frame
(Fig. 1.9). The ith particle is acted upon by an external force F
i
and by N? 1 internal

(j null i) due to the other particles. The equation of motion for the ith
particle is
m
i
¨ r
i
= F
i
+
N
null j=1
f
ij
(1.82)
The right-hand side of the equation is equal to the total force acting on the ith particle,
external plus internal, and we note that f
ii
= 0; that is, a particle cannot act on itself to
in?uence its motion.
Now sum (1.82) over the N particles.

Because of Newton’s law of action and reaction, we have
f

(1.84)
and therefore
N

N
null j=1
f
ij
= 0 (1.85)
The center of mass location is given by

m
N
null i=1
m
i
r

(1.86)
where the total mass m is
m=
N

(1.87)
Then (1.83) reduces to
m¨ r
c
= F (1.88)
where the total external force acting on the system is
F=
N
null i=1
F
i
(1.89)
This result shows that the motion of the center of mass of a system of particles is the same
as that of a single particle of total mass m which is driven by the total external forceF.
The translational or linear momentum of a system of N particles is equal to the vector
sum of the momenta of the individual particles. Thus, using (1.3), we ?nd that
p=

p

(1.90)

where each particle mass m

mentum is

? p

=

null i=1
m
i
¨ r
i
= F (1.91)
in agreement with (1.88). Note that ifF remains equal to zero over some time interval, the
linear momentum remains constant during the interval. More particularly, if a component
of F in a certain ?xed direction remains at zero, then the corresponding component ofp is
conserved.
Angular momentum
The angular momentum of a single particle of mass m
i
about a ?xed reference point O
(Fig. 1.10) is
H
i
= r
i
× m
i
? r
i
= r

×p

(1.92)
which has the form of a moment of momentum. Upon summation over N particles, we ?nd
that the angular momentum of the system about O is

Notice that the velocity ? ?
i
is measured relative to the reference point P rather than being an
absolute velocity. The use of relative versus absolute velocities in the de?nition of angular
momentum makes no difference if the reference point is either ?xed or at the center of mass.
There is a difference, however, in the form of the equation of motion for the general case of
an accelerating reference point P, which is not at the center of mass. In this case, the choice
of relative velocities yields simpler and physically more meaningful equations of motion.
To ?nd the angular momentum relative to the center of mass, we take the reference point
P at the center of mass (?
c
= 0) and obtain
H
c

N
null i=1
?
i
× m

? ?

(1.95)
where?

is now the position vector of particle m

relative to the center of mass.
Now let us write an expression forH

Then, recalling (1.94), we ?nd that

c

(1.98)
This important result states that the angular momentum about an arbitrary point P is equal
to the angular momentum about the center of mass plus the angular momentum due to the
relative translational velocity ? ?
c
of the center of mass. Of course, this result also applies to
the case of a ?xed reference point P when ? ?
c
is an absolute velocity.
Now let us differentiate (1.93) with respect to time in order to obtain an equation of
motion. We obtain

and we note that

since, by Newton’s third law, the internal forces f

(1.102)
where M

?

¨ ?

(1.103)

(¨ r

(1.104)
Now take the vector product of?

with both sides of this equation and sum over i. We ?nd
that

¨ r
c

since

N

because the internal forcesf

whereM

is the external applied moment about the center of mass.
At this point we have found that the basic rotational equation
?
H= M (1.110)
applies in each of two cases: (1) the reference point is ?xed in an inertial frame; or (2) the
reference point is at the center of mass.
20 Introductiontoparticledynamics
Finally, let us consider the most general case of an arbitrary reference point P. Upon
differentiating (1.98) with respect to time, we obtain
?

H

c

(1.111)
But, from Newton’s law of motion for the system,

so we obtain
?
H
p

The applied moment about P is

Thus, the rotational equation for this general case is
?
H
p

??
c

p
(1.115)
We note immediately that this equation reverts to the simpler form of (1.110) if P is a ?xed
point (¨ r
p
= 0) or if P is located at the center of mass (?
c
= 0). The right-hand term also
vanishes if?
c
and ¨ r
p
are parallel.
Accelerating frames
Consider a particle of mass m
i
and its motion relative to a noninertial reference frame
that is not rotating but is translating with point P at its origin (Fig. 1.10). The equation of
motion is
m
i
(¨ r
p
+ ¨ ?
i
)= F
i
(1.116)
where F
i
is now the total force acting on the particle. Relative to the accelerating frame,
the equation of motion has the form
m
i
¨ ?
i
= F
i
? m
i
¨ r
p
(1.117)
The term?m
i
¨ r

can be regarded as an inertia force due to the acceleration of the frame.
Note that the same equation of motion is obtained if we assume that the frame attached to
P is not accelerating, but instead there is a uniform gravitational ?eld with an acceleration
of gravity?¨ r
p
.
As another example of motion relative to an accelerating reference frame, consider again
the rotational equation given in (1.115). We can write it in the form
?
H
p
= M
p
?
N
null i=1
?
i

¨ r

(1.118)
21 Systemsofparticles
since
m?
c
=
N
null i=1
m
i
?
i
(1.119)
gives the position?
c
of the center of mass. The last term of (1.118) can be interpreted as
the moment about P of individual inertia forces?m
i
¨ r
p
that act on each particle m
i
,t h e
forces being parallel in the manner of an arti?cial gravitational ?eld. The total moment of
these inertial forces, as given in (1.115), is??
c
× m¨ r
p
, which can be considered as a total
inertia force?m¨ r
p
acting at the center of mass.
The concept of inertia forces and an arti?cial gravitational ?eld due to an accelerating
reference frame can be expressed as the following principle of relative motion: All the
results and principles derivable from Newton’s laws of motion relative to an inertial frame
can be extended to apply to an accelerating but nonrotating frame if the inertia forces
associated with the acceleration of the frame are considered as additional forces acting
on the particles of the system. This important result is particularly useful if some reference
point in the system has an acceleration that is a known function of time. Note that it applies
to work and energy principles relative to the accelerating frame without having to solve for
the forces causing the acceleration.

where we recall that

= 0 (1.125)
for this center of mass reference point. Equation (1.124) is an expression of Koenig’s
theorem: The total kinetic energy of a system of particles is equal to that due to the total
mass moving with the velocity of the center of mass plus that due to the motion of individual
particles relative to the center of mass.
As a further generalization, let us consider a system of particles with a general reference
point P (Fig. 1.10). Here we have

(1.127)
We see that the total kinetic energy is the sum of three parts: (1) the kinetic energy due
to the total mass moving at the speed of the reference point; (2) the kinetic energy due
to motion relative to the reference point; and (3) the scalar product of the reference point
velocity and the linear momentum of the system relative to the reference point. Equation
(1.127) is an important and useful result. It is particularly convenient in the analysis of
systems having a reference point whose motion is known but which is not at the center of
mass.
Now let us look into the relationship between the work done on a system of particles

Thus, equating the line integrals obtained from (1.128), we ?nd that

This is the principle of work and kinetic energy: The increase in the kinetic energy of a
system of particles over an arbitrary time interval is equal to the work done on the system
by external and internal forces during that time. Since this principle applies continuously
to an evolving system, we see that
?
T =

W (1.134)
that is, the rate of increase of kinetic energy is equal to the rate of doing work by the forces
acting on the system.
If we choose a center of mass reference point, we have

where A

are the end-points of the path followed by the center of mass. The equation
of motion for the center of mass is identical in form with that of a single particle; hence,
they will have similar work–energy relationships. Therefore, the work done by the total
external force F in moving through the displacement of the center of mass must equal the
increase in the kinetic energy associated with the center of mass motion, as given in the ?rst
term of (1.124). Then the remaining term in the work expression, representing the work of
the external and internal forces in moving through displacements relative to the center of
mass, must equal the increase in the kinetic energy of relative motions, that is, in the change
in the last term of (1.124).
Conservation of energy
Let us consider a particle whose position (x, y, z) is given relative to an inertial Cartesian
frame. Suppose that the work done on the particle in an arbitrary in?nitesimal displacement is
dW= F· dr= F
x
dx+ F
y

and the right-hand side is equal to the total differential of a function of position. Let us take
dW=? dV=?

?V

?V

where the minus sign is chosen for convenience and the potential energy function is

(1.139)
or, using vector notation,
F=?? V (1.140)
that is, the force is equal to the negative gradient of V (x, y, z).
In accordance with the principle of work and kinetic energy, the increase in kinetic energy
is
dT = dW=? dV (1.141)
so we ?nd that
?
T +
?
V = 0 (1.142)
or, after integration with respect to time,
T + V = E (1.143)
where the total energy E is a constant. This is the principle of conservation of energy applied
to a rather simple system.
This principle can easily be extended to apply to a system of N particles whose positions
are given by the 3N Cartesian coordinates x
1
, x
2
,...,x
3N
. In this case, the kinetic energy
T is the sum of the individual kinetic energies, and the overall potential energy V (x)i sa
function of the particle positions. The force in the positive x

direction obtained from V is
F

(1.144)
The system will be conservative, that is, the total energy T + V will be constant if it
meets the following conditions: (1) the potential energy V (x) is a function of position only
and not an explicit function of time; and (2) all forces which do work on the system in
the actual motion are obtained from the potential energy in accordance with (1.144); any
constraint forces do no work. Later the concept of a conservative system will be extended
and generalized.
It sometimes occurs that the forces doing work on a system are all obtained from a
potential energy function of the more general form V (x, t) by using (1.144) or (1.140).
In this case, the forces are termed monogenic, that is, derivable from a potential energy
function, whether conservative or not.

Uniform gravity Suppose a particle of mass m is located at a distance y above a reference
level in the presence of a uniform gravitational ?eld whose gravitational acceleration is g,

energy at the reference level.
Inverse-square gravity A uniform spherical body of mass m

and we have used units of Newtons, meters, and kilograms. Equation (1.148) is a statement

(1.149)
which integrates to

(1.150)
and we note that the gravitational potential energy is generally negative, but goes to zero as
r?? .
Linear spring A commonly encountered form of potential energy is that due to elastic
deformation. As an example, consider a particle P which is attached by a linear spring of
stiffness k to a ?xed point O, as shown in Fig. 1.11c. The force of the spring acting on the
particle is

where x is the elongation of the spring, measured from its unstressed position. Integration

(1.152)
Example 1.5 A particle of mass m is displaced slightly from its equilibrium position
at the top of a smooth ?xed sphere of radius r, and it slides downward due to gravity
(Fig. 1.12). We wish to solve for its velocity as a function of position, and the angle? at
which it loses contact with the sphere.
Rather than writing the tangential equation of motion involving
¨
? and then integrating,
we can solve directly for the velocity of the particle by using conservation of energy. We
see that
T =

(1.153)
and, using the center O as the reference level,
V = mgr cos? (1.154)

Example 1.6 Particles A and B, each of mass m, are connected by a rigid massless rod
of length l, as shown in Fig. 1.13. Particle A is restrained by a linear spring of stiffness k,
but can slide without friction on a plane inclined at 45
?
with the horizontal. We wish to
obtain the differential equations for the planar motion of this system under the action of
gravity.
It will simplify matters if we can obtain the differential equations of motion without
having to solve for either the normal constraint force of the inclined plane acting on particle
A, or for the compressive force of the rod acting on both particles. First, let us write Newton’s

where x is measured from the position of zero force in the spring. This is the x equation of

Next, let us write the rotational equation, using A as a reference point where A has
an acceleration ¨ x down the plane. Thus, we must use (1.118) for motion relative to an
accelerating frame. This means that an inertia force m ¨ x is applied at B and is directed
upward, parallel to the plane. Then, relative to A, the gravitational and inertial moments are
added. Thus, we obtain

Friction
Systems with friction are characterized by the loss of energy due to relative motion of the
particles. Thus, in general, they are not conservative. The two principal types of frictional
forces to be considered here are linear damping and Coulomb friction.
Linear damping
A linear viscous damper with a damping coef?cient c is shown connected between two
particles in Fig. 1.15. It is assumed to be massless and produces a tensile force proportional
to the relative separation rate of the particles in accordance with the equation
F
i
= c ( ? x
j
? ? x
i
) (1.174)
In other words, the damper force always opposes any relative motion of the particles and
therefore does negative work on the system, dissipating energy whenever a relative velocity
exists.

Coulomb friction
A Coulomb friction force is dissipative, like other friction forces, but is nonlinear; that is,
the friction force is a nonlinear function of the relative sliding velocity. As an example,
suppose that block A slides with velocityv
r
relative to block B, as shown in Fig. 1.16. The
force of block B acting on block A has a positive normal component N and a tangential
friction componentµ N, where the coef?cient of sliding frictionµ is independent of the
relative sliding velocityv
r
. In detail, the Coulomb friction force is
F
f
=?µ N sgn(v
r
) (1.175)
where F
f
andv
r
are positive in the same direction and where sgn(v
r
) equals± 1, depending
on the sign ofv
r
. Note that F
f
is independent of the contact area.
In the casev
r
= 0, that is, for no sliding, the force of friction can have any magnitude
less than that required to initiate sliding. The actual force in this case is obtained from the
equations of statics. Although the force required to begin sliding is actually slightly larger
than that required to sustain it, we shall ignore this difference and assume that F
f
as a
function ofv
r
is given by Fig. 1.16b or (1.175).
Since the magnitude|F
f
|?µ N, we see that the direction of the total force of block B
acting on block A cannot deviate from the normal to the sliding surface by more than an
angle? where
tan?=µ (1.176)
This leads to the idea of a cone of friction having a semivertex angle?. The total force
vector must lie on or within the cone of friction. It lies on the cone during sliding.

Example 1.8 Two blocks, each of mass m, are connected by a linear damper and spring
in series, as shown in Fig. 1.17. They can slide without friction on a horizontal plane. First,
we wish to derive the differential equations of motion.
Using Newton’s law of motion, we ?nd that the x

equation is
m ¨ x
1
= c( ? x
3
? ? x

) (1.177)
Similarly, the x
2
equation is
m ¨ x
2
= k(x

? x

) (1.178)
We note that the forces in the damper and spring are equal, so we obtain the ?rst-order
equation
c ( ? x
3
? ? x
1
)= k (x
2
? x
3
) (1.179)
These are the three linear differential equations of motion. They are equivalent to ?ve
?rst-order equations, so the total order of the system is ?ve.
This system is unusual because the coordinate x
3
, which is associated with the connecting
point P between the damper and spring, does not involve displacement of any mass. This
results in an odd total order of the system rather than the usual even number. It is also
re?ected in the degree of the characteristic equation and in the required number of initial
conditions.
Second method Let us assume the initial conditions
x
1
(0)= 0, x

(0)= 0, x
3
(0)= 0 (1.180)
and
? x
1
(0)= 0, ? x
2
(0)=v
0
(1.181)
We see from (1.179) that ? x
3
(0)= 0.
The analysis of this system can be simpli?ed if we notice that the center of mass moves
at a constant velocity
1
2
v
0
due to conservation of linear momentum. Thus, a frame moving
with the center of mass is an inertial frame, and Newton’s laws of motion apply relative
to this frame. Let us use the coordinates x
1c
, x
2c
, x
3c
for positions relative to the center of
mass frame and assume that the origins of the two frames coincide at t = 0. Then we have
the initial conditions

(1.184)
and simplify by writing equations of motion for x

To obtain some idea of the nature of the system response, we can assume solutions of
the exponential form e
st
, and obtain the resulting characteristic equation which turns out
to be a cubic polynomial in s. One root is zero and the other two have negative real parts.
Thus, the solutions for x
2c
and x
3c
each consist of two exponentially decaying functions of
time plus a constant. As time approaches in?nity, the exponential functions will vanish with
x
2c
= x
3c
and no force in the spring or damper. The length of the linear damper, however,
will have increased by 2x
3c
compared with its initial value.
Finally, to obtain the solutions in the original inertial frame, we use

The Coulomb friction force between blocks A and B is 0.5mg whereas the friction force
between block B and the ?oor is 0.2mg. The friction forces oppose relative motion so the
initial accelerations of blocks A and B are
¨ x

1.3 Constraints and con?guration space
Generalized coordinates and con?guration space
Consider a system of N particles. The con?guration of this system is speci?ed by giving
the locations of all the particles. For example, the inertial location of the ?rst particle
might be given by the Cartesian coordinates (x
1
, x
2
, x
3
), the location of the second particle
by (x
4
, x
5
, x
6
), and so forth. Thus, the con?guration of the system would be given by
35 Constraintsandcon?gurationspace
(x
1
, x
2
,...,x
3N
). In the usual case, the particles cannot all move freely but are at least
somewhat constrained kinematically in their differential motions, if not in their large motions
as well. Under these conditions, it is usually possible to give the con?guration of the system
by specifying the values of fewer than 3N parameters. These n? 3N parameters are called
generalized coordinates (qs) and are related to the xsbythetransformation equations
x
k
= x
k
(q
1
,q
2
,...,q
n
, t)( k= 1,...,3N) (1.198)
The qs are not necessarily uniform in their dimensions. For example, the position of a
particle in planar motion may be expressed by the polar coordinates (r,?) which have
differing dimensions. Thus, generalized coordinates may include common coordinate
systems. However, a generalized coordinate may also be chosen such that it is not identi?ed
with any of the common coordinate systems, but represents a displacement form or shape
involving several particles. In this case, the generalized coordinate is de?ned assuming
certain displacement ratios and relative directions among the particles. For example, a
generalized coordinate might consist of equal radial displacements of particles at the
vertices of an equilateral triangle.
Frequently one attempts to ?nd a set of independent generalized coordinates, but this
is not always possible. So, in general, we assume that there are m independent equations
of constraint involving the qs and possibly the ? qs. If, for the same system, there are l
independent equations of constraint involving the 3Nx s (and possibly the corresponding
? xs), then
3N? l = n? m (1.199)
and this is equal to the number of degrees of freedom. The number of degrees of freedom
is, in general, a property of the system and not of the choice of coordinates.
Since the con?guration of a system is speci?ed by the values of its n generalized coordi-
nates, one can represent any particular con?guration by a point in n-dimensional con?gu-
ration space (Fig. 1.19). If the values of all the qs and ? qs are known at some initial time t
0
,
then, as time proceeds, the con?guration point C will trace a solution path in con?guration
space in accordance with the dynamical equations of motion and any constraint equations.
For the case of independent qs, the curve will be continuous but otherwise not constrained.
If, however, there are holonomic constraints expressed as functions of the qs and possibly
time, then the solution point must remain on a hypersurface having fewer thann dimensions,
and which may be moving and possibly changing shape. In general, then, one can represent
an evolving mechanical system by an n-dimensional vectorq, drawn from the origin to the
con?guration point C, tracing a path in con?guration space as time proceeds. This will be
discussed further in Chapter 2.
Holonomic constraints
Suppose that the con?guration of a system is speci?ed by n generalized coordinates
(q
1
,..., q
n
) and assume that there are m independent equations of constraint of the form
?
j
(q

A constraint of this form is called a holonomic constraint. A dynamical system whose
constraint equations, if any, are all of the holonomic form is called a holonomic system.
An example of a holonomic constraint is provided by a particle which is forced to move
on a sphere of radius R centered at the origin of a Cartesian frame. In this case the equation
of constraint is
?
j
= x
2
+ y
2
+ z
2
? R
2
= 0 (1.201)
where (x, y, z) is the location of the particle. The sphere is a two-dimensional constraint
surface which is embedded in a three-dimensional Cartesian space.
The con?guration of a holonomic system can always be speci?ed using a minimal set of
generalized coordinates equal in number to the degrees of freedom. This is also the number
of dimensions of the constraint hypersurface, that is, n? m. Hence it is always possible
in theory to ?nd a set of independent qs describing a holonomic system. For the case of a
spherical constraint surface, one could use angles of latitude and longitude to describe the
position of a particle. Another possibility might be to use the cylindrical coordinates? and
z as qs, where? effectively gives the longitude and z the latitude.
Nonholonomic constraints
Nonholonomic constraints may have the general form
f
j
(q, ? q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (1.202)
but usually they have a simpler form which is linear in the velocities. Thus, we nearly
always assume that nonholonomic constraints have the form
f

(q, t)dt=0( j = 1,...,m) (1.204)
where, in either case, these expressions are not integrable. If either expression were inte-
grable, then a function?
j
(q, t) would exist and (1.200) would apply, indicating that the
constraint is actually holonomic. In this case, we would have

for this holonomic constraint. We conclude that holonomic and “linear” nonholonomic
constraints can be expressed in the forms of (1.203) and (1.204). The holonomic case
is distinguished by its integrability. Note that the coef?cients a
ji
(q, t) and a
jt
(q, t)a r e
generally nonlinear in the qs and t.
Other constraint classi?cations
A constraint is classed as scleronomic if the time t does not appear explicitly in the equation
of constraint. Otherwise, it is rheonomic. Thus, a scleronomic holonomic constraint has the
form
?
j
(q)= 0 (1.207)
A scleronomic nonholonomic constraint has the form
n
null i=1
a
ji
(q) ? q
i
= 0 (1.208)
where we note that a
jt
? 0.
Constraints having a
jt
null 0, or a
ji
= a
ji
(q, t), or?
j
=?
j
(q, t) are classed as rheonomic
constraints. Typical examples of rheonomic constraints are a rod of varying length l(t)
connecting two particles in the holonomic case, or a knife edge whose orientation angle is
an explicit function of time in the nonholonomic case.
A catastatic constraint has ??
j
/?t ? 0 if holonomic, or a
jt
? 0 if nonholonomic.
Catastatic constraints have an important place in dynamical theory. Note that all scleronomic
constraints are also catastatic, but not necessarily vice versa. For example, a nonholonomic
constraint having the form
n
null i=1
a
ji
(q, t) ? q
i
= 0 (1.209)
is catastatic but is not scleronomic.
38 Introductiontoparticledynamics
Dynamical systems can also be classi?ed as scleronomic or rheonomic. A scleronomic
system satis?es the conditions that: (1) all constraints, if any, are scleronomic; and (2)
the transformation equations, given by (1.198), which relate inertial Cartesian coordinates
and generalized coordinates do not contain time explicitly. As an example illustrating the
importance of the second condition, consider a particle moving on a spherical surface,
centered at the origin, whose radius R(t) is a known function of time. We can use the
spherical coordinates? and? as independent generalized coordinates, that is, there are no
constraints on the qs. Hence, the ?rst condition is satis?ed. The transformation equations,
however, are
x = R(t) sin? cos?
y = R(t) sin? sin? (1.210)
z = R(t) cos?
These transformation equations do not satisfy the second condition, so the system is rheo-
nomic.
Another classi?cation of dynamical systems involves the categories catastatic or
acatastatic. A catastatic system satis?es the conditions that: (1) all constraints, if any,
are catastatic; and (2) the system is capable of being continuously at rest by setting all the
? qs equal to zero. This implies that?x
k
/?t ? 0fork= 1,...,3N; that is, for all the trans-
formation equations. In other words, x
k
= x
k
(q) in agreement with the second condition
for a scleronomic system. Acatastatic means not catastatic.
Accessibility
Constraint equations, either holonomic or nonholonomic, are kinematic in nature; that is,
they put restrictions on the possible motions of a system, irrespective of the dynamical
equations. There is an important difference in these possible motions that distinguishes
holonomic from nonholonomic systems. It lies in the accessibility of points in con?guration
space. For the case of holonomic constraints, the con?guration point moves in a reduced
space of (n? m) dimensions since it must remain on each of m constraint surfaces, that is,
on their common intersection. Thus, certain regions of n-dimensional con?guration space
are no longer accessible.
By contrast, for nonholonomic constraints, it is the differential motions which are con-
strained. Since the differential equations representing these nonholonomic constraints are
not integrable, there are no ?nite constraint surfaces in con?guration space and there is
no reduction of the accessible region. In other words, by properly choosing the path, it is
possible to reach any point in n-dimensional q-space from any other point. As an exam-
ple, a scleronomic nonholonomic constraint, as given in (1.208), can be represented by an
(n? m)-dimensional planar differential surface element. Any differential displacement dq
must lie within that plane but is otherwise unconstrained. It is possible, however, to steer
the con?guration point C and its differential element to any point of con?guration space,
provided that more than one degree of freedom exists. A scleronomic system with only one
39 Constraintsandcon?gurationspace
degree of freedom is not steerable, and therefore any such system must be integrable and
holonomic, and not fully accessible.
Exactness and integrability
Now let us consider the conditions under which a constraint function f
j
(q, ? q, t) is integrable.
If it is integrable, then a function?
j
(q, t) exists whose total time derivative is equal to
f
j
(q, ? q, t), that is,

(q, t) ? q

(q, t) (1.212)
as in (1.203). By comparing (1.211) and (1.212) we can equate coef?cients as follows:

These are the exactness conditions for integrability. In general, a function f

integrable if it has the linear form of (1.212) and if it is either (1) exact as it stands
or (2) can be made exact through multiplication by an integrating factor of the form
M

(q, t).
There is an alternative form of the exactness conditions for the case in which f
j
(q, ? q, t)
has the linear form of (1.212). First, we see that

?f

?q

Conversely, if (1.219) is satis?ed for all ? qs satisfying the constraints, then, from (1.218),
we see that the exactness conditions must apply. Hence, (1.215) and (1.219) are equivalent
statements of the exactness conditions.
Another approach to the question of integrability lies in the use of Pfaf?an differential
forms. A Pfaf?an differential formnull in the r variables x
1
,...,x
r
can be written as
null = X
1
(x)dx
1
+···+X
r
(x)dx
r
(1.220)
where the coef?cients are functions of the xs, in general. If the differential form is exact it
is equal to the total differential dnull of a functionnull (x). The exactness conditions are
?X
i
?x
j
=
?X
j
?x
i
(i, j = 1,...,r) (1.221)
that is, for all i and j. The differential formnull is integrable if it is exact, or if it can be made
exact through multiplication by an integrating factor of the form M(x).
Returning now to a consideration of nonholonomic constraints, we can write the Pfaf?an
differential form
null j
=
n
null i=1
a
ji
(q, t)dq
i
+ a
jt
(q, t)dt=0( j = 1,...,m) (1.222)
which we recognize as having been presented previously in (1.204). Of course, the exactness
conditions are, as before, those given in (1.215).
Differential forms have wide application in the study of dynamics. A common example
is the differential expression
dW=
3N
null k=1
F
k
(x)dx
k
(1.223)
for the work done in an inertial Cartesian frame on a system of N particles by the Cartesian
force components F
k
(x). This differential form may or may not be integrable. The question
of integrability is important since it relates to the existence of a potential energy function.
If integrable, there exists a potential energy function of the form V (x).
1.4 Work, energy and momentum
With the introduction of generalized coordinates and their use in specifying the kinematic
constraints on dynamical systems, we need to consider an expanded, generalized view of
work, energy, and momentum.

Virtual displacements
Suppose that the vector r
i
(q, t) gives the location of some point in a mechanical system;
for example, it might be the position vector of the ith particle written in terms of thenq s
and time. Now consider an actual differential displacement

The virtual displacement of the system can also be described by the n-dimensional vector

instantaneous or virtual constraint equations of the form

for nonholonomic constraints.
A comparison of (1.228) and (1.229) with (1.225) and (1.226) shows that virtual dis-
placements and actual displacements are different, in general, since they satisfy different
constraint equations. If the constraints are catastatic, however; that is, if any holonomic
constraints are of the form?
j
(q)= 0, and if all nonholonomic constraints have a
jt
= 0,
then the virtual and actual small displacements satisfy the same set of constraint equations.
Of course, the actual motion also satis?es the equations of motion.
The forms of (1.228) and (1.229), which are linear in the?qs, indicate that the virtual dis-
placements lie in an (n? m)-dimensional hyperplane at the operating point inn-dimensional
42 Introductiontoparticledynamics
con?guration space, in accordance with the constraints. For holonomic constraints, the plane
is tangent to the constraint surface at the operating point.
Virtual work
The concept of virtual work is fundamental to a proper understanding of dynamical theory.
First, it must be emphasized that there is a distinction between work and virtual work. The
work done by a forceF
i
acting on the ith particle as it moves between points A
i
and B
i
in
an inertial frame is equal to the line integral
W
i
=
null B i
A i
F

· dr

(1.230)

is the position vector of the ith particle. For a system of N particles, the work done
in an arbitrary small displacement of the system is
dW=

F

(1.231)
where (x

3N
) are the Cartesian coordinates of the N particles and the F
k
are the
corresponding force components applied to the particles.
Now let us transform to generalized coordinates using (1.198) and (1.224). The work
done on the system during a small displacement in the time interval dt is

In general, we assume that the virtual displacements are consistent with any constraints,
that is, they satisfy (1.228) or (1.229). But, if the system is holonomic, it is particularly
convenient to choose independent?qs.
The question arises concerning why the virtual work?W receives so much attention
in dynamical theory rather than the work dW of the actual motion. The reason lies in the
nature of constraint forces. An ideal constraint is a workless constraint which may be either
scleronomic or rheonomic. By workless we mean that no work is done by the constraint
forces in an arbitrary reversible virtual displacement that satis?es the virtual constraint
equations having the form of (1.228) or (1.229). Examples of ideal constraints include
frictionless constraint surfaces, or rolling contact without slipping, or a rigid massless rod
connecting two particles. Another example is a knife-edge constraint that allows motion in
the direction of the knife edge without friction, but does not allow motion perpendicular
to the knife edge. Ideal constraint forces, such as the internal forces in a rigid body, may
do work on individual particles due to a virtual displacement, but no work is done on the
system as a whole because these forces occur in equal, opposite and collinear pairs.
It is convenient to consider the total force acting on the ith particle to be the sum of the
applied force F
i
and the constraint force R
i
, by which we mean an ideal constraint force.
Thus, all forces that are not ideal constraint forces are classed as applied forces. Frequently
the applied forces are known, but the constraint forces either are unknown or are dif?cult
to calculate.
44 Introductiontoparticledynamics
The advantage of using virtual displacements rather than actual displacements in dynam-
ical analyses can be seen by considering the virtual work of all the forces acting on a system
of particles. We ?nd that
?W =

(F

(1.242)
since

Thus, ideal constraint forces can be ignored in calculating the virtual work of all the
forces acting on a system. On the other hand,
N

in the general case, indicating that constraint forces can contribute to the workdW resulting
from a small actual displacement. To summarize, one can ignore the constraint forces in
applying virtual work methods. This advantage will carry over to equations derived using
virtual work, an example being Lagrange’s equation.
Example 1.10 In this example we will show how a generalized force can be calculated
using virtual work. In general, the generalized force Q
i
is equal to the virtual work per unit
?q
i
, assuming that the other?qs are set equal to zero, that is, assuming independent?qs.
This is in accordance with (1.241).
Consider a system (Fig. 1.20) consisting of two particles connected by a rigid rod of
length L. Let (x, y) be the position of particle 1, and let? be the angle of the rod relative

to the x-axis. A forceF, perpendicular to the rod, is applied at a distance l from particle 1.
We wish to solve for the generalized forces Q
x
, Q
y
, and Q
?
.
First, we see that
F=? F sin? i+ F cos? j (1.245)
where i and j are Cartesian unit vectors. The virtual displacement?r at the point of appli-
cation ofF is
?r= (?x? l sin??? )i + (?y+ l cos??? )j (1.246)
Thus, the virtual work is
?W = F·?r=? F sin?? x+ F cos?? y+ Fl?? (1.247)
From (1.241) we have
?W = Q

?x+ Q

Then, by comparing coef?cients of the?qs, we ?nd that the generalized forces are

Note that Q

and Q

is the moment about
particle 1.
Principle of virtual work
A system of particles is in static equilibrium if each particle of the system is in static
equilibrium. A particle is in static equilibrium if it is motionless at the initial time t = 0,
and if its acceleration remains zero for all t ? 0.
Now consider a catastatic system of particles; that is, all transformation equations from
inertial xstoqs do not contain time explicitly. This implies that all particles are at rest if all
? qs equal zero. For such a system we can state the principle of virtual work: The necessary
and suf?cient condition for the static equilibrium of an initially motionless catastatic system
which is subject to ideal bilateral constraints is that zero virtual work is done by the applied
forces in moving through an arbitrary virtual displacement satisfying the constraints.
To explain this principle, ?rst assume that the catastatic system is in static equilibrium.
Then
F
i
+R
i
=0( i = 1,...,N) (1.250)
implying that each particle has zero acceleration. Now take the dot product with?r

and
sum over i. We obtain

(F

and we assume that the?rs satisfy the constraints. The virtual work of the constraint forces
equals zero, that is,

the suf?cient condition.

wish to solve for the inclination? of the spring and its tensile force F at the position of

Notice that, at the equilibrium con?guration, the angle? and force F do not depend

the spring by a massless rigid rod of length L. Then?x

For a simple system such as a single particle whose position is given by the Cartesian
coordinates (x, y), the x-component of generalized momentum is just the x-component of
linear momentum m ? x. On the other hand, if the position of the particle is given by the
polar coordinates (r,?), then p
?
is equal to mr

?
?, which is the angular momentum about
the origin. For more general choices of coordinates, the generalized momentum may not
have an easily discerned physical meaning. Because the generalized coordinates associated
with a given system do not necessarily have the same units or dimensions, neither will the
corresponding generalized momenta. However, the product p
i
? q
i
will always have the units
of energy.
Example 1.12 Two particles, each of mass m are connected by a rigid massless rod of
length l to form a dumbbell that can move in the xy-plane. The position of the ?rst particle
is (x, y) and the direction of the second particle relative to the ?rst is given by the angle?

1.5 Impulse response
Linear impulse and momentum
Consider a system of N particles whose position vectors r

are measured relative to an
inertial frame. Newton’s law of motion for the system is

whereF is the total external force andp is the total linear momentum.

where m is the total mass andr

Now integrate (1.307) with respect to time over an interval t

to t

. We obtain
null p= p

=
ˆ
F (1.308)
where the linear impulse
ˆ
F is given by
ˆ
F=
null t 2
t 1
Fdt (1.309)
Equation (1.308) is a statement of the principle of linear impulse and momentum: The
change in the total linear momentum of a system of particles over a given time interval is
equal to the total impulse of the external forces acting on the system. Notice that the interval
is arbitrary and not necessarily small.
Since a vector equation is involved in this principle, a similar scalar equation must apply to
each component, provided that the component represents a ?xed direction in inertial space.
54 Introductiontoparticledynamics
If any component of the total impulse is zero, the change in the corresponding component
of linear momentum is also zero. If F or one of its components is continuously equal to
zero, the corresponding linear momentum is constant. In this case, there is conservation of
linear momentum.
Angular impulse and momentum
Again consider a system of N particles and take a reference point P which is either (1) a
?xed point, or (2) at the center of mass. The differential equation for the angular momentum
has the simple form
?
H= M (1.310)
Integrating this equation with respect to time over the interval t
1
to t
2
, we obtain
null H= H

?H

ˆ
M (1.311)
where the angular impulse
ˆ
M due to the external forces is
ˆ
M=
null t 2
t 1
Mdt (1.312)
Note that the internal forces between particles occur in equal, opposite and collinear pairs.
Hence, they do not contribute toM or
ˆ
M.
Equation (1.311) is a statement of the principle of angular impulse and momentum.
Note thatnull H can be zero even if M is not continuously zero. On the other hand, if M
is continuously zero, then
ˆ
M= 0 over any interval, and there is conservation of angular
momentum. Similarly, if a certain component of M remains equal to zero, even though M
itself is not zero, then there is conservation of that component of H. Here we assume that
the direction of the component is ?xed in inertial space.
Now let us choose an arbitrary reference point P for angular momentum. The equation
of motion obtained earlier has the form
?

causing particle B to slide without friction on the horizontal ?oor. Solve for the values of

Figure1.24.
Assume that the spheres are moving in the plane of the ?gure just before impact. At the
moment of impact, the interaction forces are normal to the tangent plane at the point of
contact, and therefore are directed along the line of centers. Let us assume that these forces
are impulsive in nature, that is, they are very large in magnitude and very short in duration.
As a result, there can be sudden changes in translational velocities, but rotational motion is
not involved.
Letv
n1
andv
n2
represent the velocity components along the line of centers just before
impact, and assume thatv
n1
>v
n2
. Letv
t1
andv
t2
be the corresponding tangential compo-
nents; that is, they are perpendicular to the line of centers. Because the spheres are smooth,
there are no tangential interaction forces, and therefore no changes in tangential velocities.
So we obtain
v
null t1
=v
t1
(1.322)
v
null t2
=v

(1.323)
which implies the conservation of tangential momentum of each particle.
The interaction impulses along the line of centers are equal and opposite, so there is
conservation of the total normal momentum. Thus we have

In other words, considering normal components, the relative velocity of separation after
impact is equal to e times the relative velocity of approach before impact. Solving (1.324)
and (1.325) forv

velocities of approach and separation are equal. There is conservation of energy during
perfectly elastic impact, but there is some energy loss for 0? e< 1.
During the impact of two smooth spheres, there are equal and opposite impulses acting
on the spheres along the line of centers. These impulses are of magnitude

Now suppose that Coulomb friction with a coef?cientµ is introduced at the impacting
surfaces. If sliding occurs throughout the impact, there will be equal and opposite friction
impulsesµ ˆ
F acting to oppose the relative sliding motion. In other words, the total interaction
impulse of each body will lie along a cone of friction. It may turn out, however, that the
magnitudeµ ˆ
F of the calculated friction impulse is larger than that required to stop the
relative sliding motion. In this case, the relative sliding motion will not reverse, but will
stop at zero with the friction impulse reduced accordingly.
We have assumed that the initial and ?nal velocity vectors, as well as the line of centers,
all lie in the same plane. If this is not true, one can choose an inertial frame translating with
sphere 2 just before impact as the reference frame. Then, relative to this second reference
frame,v
n2
andv
t2
are both equal to zero. The relative velocity vector of particle 1 and
the line of centers determine the plane in which the action takes place and for which the
standard equations such as (1.326) and (1.327) apply. After solving for the primed velocity
vectors relative to the second reference frame, one can ?nally transform to the original
inertial frame by adding vectorially the velocity of this second frame.

by a rigid massless rod of length l (Fig. 1.25). The dumbbell, with? = 45

falling vertically downwards with velocityv

The impulse applied to particle 1 by the surface must be vertical since the horizontal
surface is frictionless. Hence there is no horizontal impulse applied to the system, and
its linear momentum in the x direction remains equal to zero. This implies that the x-
components of velocity of particles 1 and 2 are equal and opposite. Hence the velocity of

Impulse and energy
Consider a particle of mass m and velocity v

which is subject to a total impulse
ˆ
F.F r o m
the principle of linear impulse and momentum we know that
m(v?v

)=
ˆ
F (1.368)
where v is the velocity of the particle immediately after the impulse. Now take the dot

Then, by the principle of work and kinetic energy, the work done on the particle is
W =

2
ˆ
F· (v+v
0
) (1.370)
This result is valid even if the forceF and the time interval are ?nite and arbitrary because
these assumptions apply to the principle of linear impulse and momentum (1.368). For
motion in a straight line, the work done on a particle is equal to the impulse times the mean
of the initial and ?nal velocities.
Example 1.16 A ?exible inextensible rope of length L and linear density? initially lies
straight and motionless on a smooth horizontal ?oor (Fig. 1.27). Then, at t = 0, end A is
suddenly moved to the right with a constant speedv
0
. Considering the rope as a system of
particles, let us look into the applicable impulse and momentum principles, as well as work
and kinetic energy relations.
Assuming that x(0)= 0, y(0)= 0, we see that
y= 2x (1.371)

and therefore

Consider a mass element?dx which suddenly has its velocity changed from zero tov
0
.
Using the principle of linear impulse and momentum, the required impulse is

Thus, the force is
F =?v

? x =

?v

(1.374)
The remainder of the moving rope has zero acceleration, so the force F is constant and is due
to successive elements?dx undergoing a sudden change in velocity. This continues over
the interval 0< t< 2L/v
0
, that is, until the rope is again straight with end A leading B.
For t> 2L/v

, the applied force equals zero. Over the entire interval, the applied impulse
is

This is equal to the increase in momentum.
Now consider the work done on the system by the force F.

(1.376)
This is equal to twice the ?nal kinetic energy, where
T =

2
?Lv
2
0
(1.377)
The energy lost in the process is W ? T and is due to what amounts to inelastic impact as
each element suddenly changes its velocity from zero tov
0
.
Another viewpoint is obtained by considering an inertial frame in which end A is ?xed
for t> 0 and end B moves to the left with velocityv
0
. In this case,
F =
1
2
?v
2
0
(1.378)
as before, but F does no work since A is ?xed. The lost energy is equal to the initial kinetic
energy
1
2
?Lv
2
0
because the ?nal energy is zero. We see that, although the work of F as well
65 Bibliography
as the initial and ?nal kinetic energies are different in the two inertial frames, the lost energy
is unchanged. Relative to this second inertial frame, it is more obvious that the lost energy
is due to inelastic impact, since the velocity of each element?dx has its velocity suddenly
changed fromv
0
to zero.

Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
In our study of the dynamics of a system of particles, we have been concerned primarily
with the Newtonian approach which is vectorial in nature. In general, we need to know
the magnitudes and directions of the forces acting on the system, including the forces of
constraint. Frequently the constraint forces are not known directly and must be included as
additional unknown variables in the equations of motion. Furthermore, the calculation of
particle accelerations can present kinematical dif?culties.
An alternate approach is that of analytical dynamics, as represented by Lagrange’s equa-
tions and Hamilton’s equations. These methods enable one to obtain a complete set of
equations of motion by differentiations of a single scalar function, namely the Lagrangian
function or the Hamiltonian function. These functions include kinetic and potential ener-
gies, but ideal constraint forces are not involved. Thus, orderly procedures for obtaining the
equations of motion are available and are applicable to a wide range of problems.
2.1 D’Alembert’s principle and Lagrange’s equations
D’Alembert’s principle
Let us begin with Newton’s law of motion applied to a system of N particles. For the ith
particle of mass m

and inertial positionr

? m

¨ r

where F

is the applied force and R

is the constraint force. Now take the scalar product
with a virtual displacement?r

and sum over i. We obtain
N
null i=1
(F
i
+R
i
? m

¨ r

)·?r

This result is valid for arbitrary?rs; but now assume that the?rs satisfy the instantaneous
or virtual constraint equations, namely,
3N
null i=1
a

(x, t)?x
i
=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.3)
74 Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
where the?xs are the Cartesian components of the?rs. The virtual work of the constraint
forces must vanish, that is,
N
null i=1
R
i
·?r
i
= 0 (2.4)
Then (2.2) reduces to
N
null i=1
(F
i
? m
i
¨ r
i
) ·?r
i
= 0 (2.5)
This important result is the Lagrangian form of d’Alembert’s principle. It states that the
virtual work of the applied forces plus the inertia forces is zero for all virtual displacements
satisfying the instantaneous constraints, that is, with time held ?xed. The forces due to ideal
constraints do not enter into these equations. This important characteristic will be re?ected
in various dynamical equations derived using d’Alembert’s principle, including Lagrange’s
and Hamilton’s equations.
In terms of Cartesian coordinates, d’Alembert’s principle has the form
3N
null k=1
(F
k
? m
k
¨ x
k
)?x
k
= 0 (2.6)
where the?xs satisfy (2.3). Equation (2.6) is valid for any set of?xs which satisfy the
instantaneous constraints. There are (3N? m) independent sets of?xs, each being conven-
iently expressed in terms of?x
k
ratios. This results in (3N? m) equations of motion. An
additional m equations are obtained by differentiating the constraint equations of (1.203)
or, in this case,
3N
null i=1

? x

=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.7)
with respect to time. Altogether, there are now 3N second-order differential equations which
can be solved, frequently by numerical integration, for the xs as functions of time. Note
that the constraint forces have been eliminated from the equations of motion.
Example 2.1 A particle of mass m can move without friction on the inside surface of a
paraboloid of revolution (Fig. 2.1)

?nd the differential equations of motion using d’Alembert’s principle. The applied force
components are

Figure2.1.
In order to obtain the constraint equation for the virtual displacements, ?rst write (2.8)
in the differential form
?
?= 2x ? x+ 2y ? y? ? z= 0 (2.10)
The instantaneous constraint equation, obtained using (2.3), is
2x?x+ 2y?y??z= 0 (2.11)
We need to ?nd 3N? m= 2 independent virtual displacements which satisfy (2.11). We
can take
?y= 0,? z= 2x?x (2.12)
and
?x = 0,? z= 2y?y (2.13)
Then d’Alembert’s principle, (2.6), results in
[?m ¨ x? 2mx(¨ z+ g)]?x = 0 (2.14)
[?m ¨ y? 2my(¨ z+ g)]?y= 0 (2.15)
Now?x is freely variable in (2.14), as is?y in (2.15), so their coef?cients must equal zero.
Thus, after dividing by?m, we obtain
¨ x+ 2x(¨ z+ g)= 0 (2.16)
¨ y+ 2y(¨ z+ g)= 0 (2.17)
These are the dynamical equations of motion. A kinematical second-order equation is
obtained by differentiating (2.10) with respect to time, resulting in
2x ¨ x+ 2y ¨ y? ¨ z+ 2 ? x
2
+ 2 ? y
2
= 0 (2.18)
76 Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
Equations (2.16)–(2.18) can be solved for ¨ x, ¨ y and ¨ z, which are then integrated to give the
particle motion as a function of time.

to both holonomic and nonholonomic systems, requiring only that T and Q

be written as
functions of (q, ? q, t). Note that constraint forces do not enter the Q

This is the fundamental holonomic form of Lagrange’s equation. It results in n second-order

Now de?ne the Lagrangian function

Then we can write Lagrange’s equation in the standard holonomic form:

The basic forms of Lagrange’s equations, given in (2.34) and (2.37) apply to holonomic
systems described in terms of independent generalized coordinates.
When one considers nonholonomic systems, there must be more generalized coordinates
than degrees of freedom. Hence, the generalized coordinates are not completely independent
and, as a result, there will be generalized constraint forces C
i
which are nonzero, in general.
In terms of the constraint forces acting on the individual particles, we have, similar to
(1.240),

Let us use the Lagrange multiplier method to evaluate the generalized constraint forces.
First, we note that the virtual work of the constraint forces must equal zero, that is,
n

provided that the?qs satisfy the instantaneous constraints in the form

a

?q

=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.44)
79 D’Alembert’sprincipleandLagrange’sequations

j
and sum over j. We obtain
m

?q

n

m
null j=1
?
j
a

null ?q

= 0 (2.46)
Up to this point, the m ?s have been considered to be arbitrary, whereas the n ?qs
satisfy the instantaneous constraints. However, it is possible to choose the?s such that the
coef?cient of each?q
i
vanishes. Thus, the generalized constraint force C
i
is
C
i
=
m
null j=1
?
j
a
ji
(i = 1,...,n) (2.47)
and the?qs can be considered to be arbitrary.
To understand how m?s can be chosen to specify an arbitrary constraint force in ac-
cordance with (2.47), let us ?rst consider a single constraint. The corresponding constraint
force is perpendicular to the constraint surface at the operating point; that is, it is in the
direction of the vector a
j
whose components in n-space are the coef?cients a
ji
. This is
expressed by (2.44) and we note that any virtual displacement?q must lie in the tangent
plane at the operating point. The Lagrange multiplier?
j
applies equally to all components
a
ji
and so expresses the magnitude of the constraint forceC
j
=?
j
a
j
.
If there are m constraints, the total constraint forceC is found by summing the individual
constraint forces C
j
. We can consider the a
j
sa sm independent basis vectors with the?s
representing the scalar components of C in this m-dimensional subspace. Hence a set of
m?s can always be found to represent any possible total constraint forceC.
For a system with n generalized coordinates and m nonholonomic constraints, we note
?rst that the generalized constraint force C

is no longer zero, in general, and must be added
to Q

we take

First method Let us use the nonholonomic form of Lagrange’s equation given by (2.51).
The coordinates (x, y) have the holonomic constraint
?= x
2

2
? l
2
= 0 (2.55)
Differentiating with respect to time, we obtain
?
?= 2x ? x+ 2y ? y= 0 (2.56)
which leads to
a

12

The kinetic energy is
T =

2
m( ? x
2
+ ? y
2
) (2.58)
and the potential energy is
V = mgy (2.59)
The use of (2.51) results in the equations of motion
m ¨ x = 2?x (2.60)
m ¨ y = 2?y? mg (2.61)
We need a third differential equation since there are three variables (x,y,?). Differentiating
(2.56) with respect to time, and dividing by two, we obtain
x ¨ x+ y ¨ y+ ? x
2
+ ? y
2
= 0 (2.62)
This equation, plus (2.60) and (2.61) are a complete set of second-order differential equa-
tions. One can solve for? and obtain
?=

2l
2
[gy? ( ? x
2
+ ? y
2
)] (2.63)
Then one can numerically integrate (2.60) and (2.61). We see that the compressive force in
the rod is 2?l.
Second method A simpler approach is to choose? as a single generalized coordinate with
no constraints. We see that
x = l sin? (2.64)
y = l cos? (2.65)
? x = l

Third method Another possibility is to use the holonomic equation of constraint to elim-
inate one of the variables. For example, we might eliminate y and its derivatives and then
consider x to be an independent coordinate. From (2.55), we have
y=±

Assuming the positive sign, we obtain

The potential energy is

Then (2.70) leads to a differential equation for x, namely,

If y is actually negative, the sign of the last term is changed.
For a system with m holonomic constraints, one can use the constraint equations to solve
for m dependent qs and ? qs in terms of the corresponding (n? m) independent quantities.
Then one can write T and V in terms of the independent quantities only, and use simple
forms of Lagrange’s equation such as (2.70) to obtain (n? m) equations of motion. In this
example, we let x be independent and y dependent. After integrating (2.76) numerically
to obtain x as a function of time, one can use (2.72) and (2.73) to obtain the motion
in y.
It should be noted, however, that this procedure does not produce correct results if non-
holonomic constraints are involved. Various approaches which do not involve Lagrange
multipliers, but are applicable to nonholonomic systems, will be discussed in Chapter 4.
This example illustrates that the choice of generalized coordinates has a strong effect
on the complexity of the equations of motion. In this instance, the second method is by
83 D’Alembert’sprincipleandLagrange’sequations
far the simplest approach if one is interested in solving for the motion. It is not very
helpful, however, in solving for various internal forces. The ?rst method involving Lagrange
multipliers is the most direct method to solve for forces.

which states that the velocity normal to the knife-edge is zero (Fig. 2.3). Assume that the

we can differentiate the constraint equation with respect to time and obtain

These four equations are linear in ( ¨ x,¨ y,

are then integrated to yield x(t), y(t),?(t), and?(t).
In general, for a system with n generalized coordinates and m nonholonomic constraint
equations, the Lagrangian method results in n second-order differential equations of motion
plus m equations of constraint. These (n+ m) equations are solved for thenq s and m?s
as functions of time. In later chapters, we will discuss methods which are more ef?cient in
the sense of requiring fewer equations to describe a nonholonomic system.

where L(q, ? q, t)= T (q, ? q, t)? V (q, ? q, t), and V (q, ? q, t)isavelocity-dependent potential
energy function. This might be used, for example, to account for electromagnetic forces
acting on moving charged particles. In our development, however, we will continue to
assume that the potential energy has the form V (q, t), and therefore that

hence has an inverse. Thus, (2.91) can be solved for the ? qs with the result

written as
? p

(i = 1,...,n) (2.99)
Then we can write
? q

?H
?q

(i = 1,...,n) (2.100)
These 2n ?rst-order equations are known as Hamilton’s canonical equations. The ?rst n
equations express the ? qs as linear functions of the ps, as in (2.92). The ?nal n equations
contain the laws of motion for the system. Because of the symmetry in form of Hamilton’s
canonical equations, there is a tendency to accord the qs and ps equal status and think of
the qs and ps together as a 2n-dimensional phase vector. Thus, the motion of a system can
be represented by a path or trajectory in 2n-dimensional phase space.
Comparing the standard holonomic form of Lagrange’s equations with Hamilton’s canon-
ical equations, we ?nd that they are equivalent in that both require independent qs and apply
to the same mechanical systems. Hamilton’s equations are 2n ?rst-order equations rather
than the n second-order equations of Lagrange. However, it should be pointed out that
most computer representations require the conversion of higher-order equations to a larger
number of ?rst-order equations.
Form of the Hamiltonian function
Let us return to a further consideration of the Hamiltonian function H(q, p, t), as given by
(2.93). Using (2.91), we see that

Hence, using (2.93), we ?nd that

For the particular case of a scleronomic system, T
1
= T

= 0 and T = T

,so
H = T + V (2.104)
that is, the Hamiltonian function is equal to the total energy.

Other Hamiltonian equations
We have seen that Hamilton’s canonical equations apply to the same systems as the standard
holonomic form of Lagrange’s equation, (2.37). Other forms of Lagrange’s equations have
their Hamiltonian counterparts. For example, if nonpotential generalized forces Q
null i
are
present in a holonomic system, we have the Hamiltonian equations
? q

This assumes that all the applied forces arise from a potential energy V (q, t). On the other
hand, if there are nonpotential forces in a nonholonomic system, Hamilton’s equations have
the form
? q
i
=
?H
?p
i
, ? p

equations of the form
n

? q

jt
=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.113)
Thus, we have a total of (2n+ m) ?rst-order differential equations to solve fornq s,np s,
and m?s as functions of time.
It is well to notice that, as in the Lagrangian case, the nonholonomic forms of Hamilton’s
equations also apply to holonomic systems in which the motions of the qs are restricted by
holonomic constraints.

Second method Let us use the same system to illustrate the use of Lagrange multipliers
with Hamilton’s equations, as in (2.111). We will use (x,?) as generalized coordinates,
where x is the displacement of the center of the disk. There is a holonomic constraint
? x? r

quadratic in the ? qs and of the form

where m is the n× n matrix of generalized mass coef?cients. The generalized momenta
are given by the matrix equation

? q= bp (2.140)

2.3 Integrals of the motion
We have found that for a dynamical system whose con?guration is given by n indepen-
dent generalized coordinates, the Lagrangian method results in n second-order differential
92 Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
equations of motion with time as the independent variable. Any general analytical solution
of these equations of motion contains 2n constants of integration which are usually evalu-
ated from the 2n initial conditions. One method of expressing the general solution is to ?nd
2n independent functions of the form
g
j
(q, ? q, t)=?
j
(j = 1,...,2n) (2.144)
where the?s are constants. The 2n functions are called integrals or constants of the motion.
Each function g
j
maintains a constant value?
j
during the actual motion of the system. In
principle, these 2n equations can be solved for the qs and ? qs as functions of the?s and t,
that is,
q
i
= q
i
(?,t)( i = 1,...,n) (2.145)
? q
i
= ? q
i
(?,t)( i = 1,...,n) (2.146)
where these solutions satisfy (2.144).
Usually it is not possible to obtain a full set of 2n integrals of the motion by any direct
process. Nevertheless, the presence of a few integrals such as those representing conservation
of energy or momentum are very useful in characterizing the motion of a system.
If one uses the Hamiltonian approach to the equations of motion, integrals of the motion
have the form
f
j
(q, p, t)=?
j
(j = 1,...,2n) (2.147)
Under the proper conditions, the Hamiltonian function itself can be an integral of the motion.
Conservative system
A common example of an integral of the motion is the energy integral E(q, ? q, t) which is
quadratic in the ? qs and is expressed in units of energy. It satis?es the equation
E(q, ? q, t)= h (2.148)
where h is a constant that is normally evaluated from initial conditions. For scleronomic
systems with T = T
2
, the energy integral, if it exists, is equal to the sum of the kinetic and
potential energies. More generally, however, the energy integral is not equal to the total
energy. Usually it is not an explicit function of time.
Let us de?ne a conservative system as a dynamical system for which an energy integral
can be found. To obtain suf?cient conditions for the existence of an energy integral, let us
consider a system which is described by the standard nonholonomic form of Lagrange’s
equation.

If the right-hand side of (2.155) remains equal to zero as the motion proceeds, then

+ V is an energy integral and the system is conservative. The ?rst term on the
right-hand side will be zero if the nonholonomic constraint equations of the form of (2.113)
have all a
jt
= 0; that is; if they are all catastatic. The second term on the right-hand side
will be zero if neither T nor V is an explicit function of time.
To summarize, a system having holonomic or nonholonomic constraints will be conser-
vative if it meets the following conditions:
1. The standard form of Lagrange’s equation, as given by (2.149) applies.
2. All constraints can be written in the form
n
null i=1
a
ji
? q
i
=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.156)
that is, all a
jt
= 0.
3. The Lagrangian function L = T ? V is not an explicit function of time.

is conservative.

This, of course, is different from the total energy T + V .
It is interesting to study the same system using the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z)t o
specify the position of the particle. Let the Cartesian frame be ?xed in space with its origin
at the center O and with the positive z-axis pointing upward and lying on the axis of rotation.
Choose the time reference such that, at t = 0, the circular wire lies in the xz-plane. The
96 Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
transformation equations are
x = r sin? cosnull t (2.168)
y= r sin? sinnull t (2.169)
z= r cos? (2.170)
Notice the explicit functions of time, con?rming that the system is rheonomic.
The Lagrangian function has the simple form

The second constraint equation has a

null 0, so the suf?cient conditions for a conservative
system are not met with this Cartesian formulation. Here the energy function would equal
the total energy T + V , which is not constant because there is a nonzero driving moment
about the vertical axis.
Nevertheless, the energy function found earlier in (2.167) remains constant and is a valid
energy integral. When expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates, it is

We conclude that the system should be classed as conservative even though it does not meet

Ignorable coordinates
Consider a holonomic system which is described by Hamilton’s canonical equations.
? q

?H
?p

?H
?q

Now suppose that the Hamiltonian function has the form
H(q

and therefore the ?rst k generalized momenta are
p

97 Integralsofthemotion
where the?s are constants. Thekq s which do not appear in the Hamiltonian function are
called ignorable coordinates. The constant psa r eintegrals of the motion, in accordance
with (2.147).
The Hamiltonian function can now be written in the form
H(q
k+1

?q

(i = k+ 1,...,n) (2.180)
Thus, k degrees of freedom corresponding to thek ignorable coordinates have been removed
from the equations of motion. The motion of the ignorable coordinates can be recovered by
integrating
? q

i
(i = 1,...,k) (2.181)
Now let us consider ignorable coordinates from the Lagrangian viewpoint. We assume a
holonomic system whose equations of motion have the standard Lagrangian form

First, recall from (2.97) that
?L

?H
?q
i
(i = 1,...,n) (2.183)
Hence, if a certain ignorable coordinate q
i
is missing from the Hamiltonian function, it will
also be missing from the Lagrangian function. If the ?rstkq s are ignorable, the Lagrangian L
will be a function of (q
k+1
,...,q
n
, ? q
1
,..., ? q
n
, t). We would like to eliminate the ignorable
? qs from the Lagrangian formulation in order to reduce the number of degrees of freedom
in the equations of motion.
This goal may be accomplished by ?rst de?ning a Routhian function R(q

where the ignorable ? qs have been eliminated by solving the k equations

These equations are of the form of Lagrange’s equation with the Routhian function replac-
ing the Lagrangian function. There are (n? k) second-order equations in the nonignorable
variables. Thus, the Routhian procedure has succeeded in eliminating the ignorable coor-
dinates from the equations of motion and, in effect, has reduced the number of degrees of
freedom to (n? k). Usually there is no need to solve for the ignorable coordinates, but, if
necessary, they can be recovered by integrating (2.191). The k integrals of the motion asso-
ciated with the ignorable coordinates are given by (2.185) and are equal to the corresponding
generalized momenta.
Example 2.6 Consider the same system as in Example 2.5 on page 94 (Fig. 2.5) except
that it can rotate freely about the ?xed vertical axis through the center, the angle of rotation
being?. We ?nd that (?,?) are the generalized coordinates and the Lagrangian function is

Thus, it can be integrated to give? as a function of time if the initial conditions are known. On
the other hand, the Lagrangian procedure will result in two coupled second-order differential
equations in? and? and their derivatives. Of course, either procedure will yield the same
results when the equations of motion are completely integrated.
2.4 Dissipative and gyroscopic forces
Gyroscopic forces and some dissipative forces are represented in the differential equations
of motion by terms which are linear in the ? qs. Suppose, for example, that the differential
equations for a system have the form
n
null j=1
m
ij
(q, t)¨ q
j
+
n
null j=1
f
ij
(q, t) ? q
j
+ h
i
(q, ? q, t)=0( i = 1,...,n) (2.200)
The n× n coef?cient matrix f can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric matrix c and a
skew-symmetric matrixg where
f
ij
(q, t)= c
ij
(q, t)+ g
ij
(q, t)( i, j = 1,...,n) (2.201)
and
c

(i, j = 1,...,n) (2.202)
g
ij
=? g
ji
(i, j = 1,...,n) (2.203)
100 Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
Assuming that the c matrix is positive de?nite or positive semide?nite, the terms in the
equations of motion of the form c
ij
? q
j
are dissipative in nature while the terms g
ij
? q
j
are
gyroscopic and nondissipative.
Rayleigh’s dissipation function
Dissipative terms are not present in equations of motion obtained by using the standard
holonomic or nonholonomic forms of Lagrange’s equation because these terms are not
derivable from a potential energy function V (q, t). Rather, dissipative terms are often in-
troduced through an applied generalized force Q
null i
where
Q
null i
=?
n
null j=1
c
ij
(q, t) ? q
j
(i = 1,...,n) (2.204)
The cs are called damping coef?cients and form a symmetric matrix which is positive
de?nite or positive semide?nite for systems with passive linear dampers.
Now let us de?ne Rayleigh’s dissipation function F(q, ? q, t) using the equation
F =
1

n

Then we see that

We can obtain the equations of motion from

?F

where we assume that the damping forces are the only applied generalized forces which are
not derived from a potential energy function.
The rate at which these linear friction forces dissipate energy is
?

Q

? q

Thus, Rayleigh’s dissipation function is equal to half the instantaneous rate of dissipation
of the total mechanical energy. For passive dampers, this dissipation rate must be positive
or zero at all times.

damping. First, let us obtain the differential equations of motion. The kinetic and potential

m ¨ x

The dissipation function involves relative velocities only and is given by half the dissipation

(2.219)
Then, using (2.212), the equations of motion can be written in the form

m ¨ q

102 Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
We notice that the q

and q
2
motions are uncoupled, in contrast to the x motions, and
that damping is applied to the q

effects with rotating and precessing axially symmetric bodies. In this example, however, the
gyroscopic terms for a single particle are due to Coriolis accelerations. Nevertheless, if we
should consider the detailed motions of particles in a precessing gyroscope, we would ?nd
that it is the Coriolis accelerations of these particles that produce the gyroscopic moment.
Coulomb friction
The nature of Coulomb friction was introduced in Chapter 1. Brie?y, the friction force F
f
between two blocks in relative sliding motion is
F
f
=?µ Nsgn(v
r
) (2.240)
where the constantµ is the coef?cient of sliding friction, N is the normal force between
the blocks, and the direction of F
f
directly opposes the relative velocityv
r
. During sliding
the vector sum of the normal force N and the friction forceµ N lies on a cone of friction
whose axis is normal to the sliding surfaces and whose semivertex angle? is given by
tan?=µ (2.241)
If there is no sliding, the total force lies within the cone of friction.
When the Lagrangian approach is used in the analysis of systems with Coulomb friction,
one can write

(i = 1,...,n) (2.242)
105 Dissipativeandgyroscopicforces
and include the generalized Coulomb friction forces in the nonpotential Q
null i
. With this
approach, Q
null i
might actually be a frictional moment, for example.
Another approach which is particularly applicable to systems with rotating sliding sur-
faces is to consider the effect of tangential frictional stresses at every point on the surface.
The frictional stress?
f
resembles a shear stress and is equal in magnitude toµ?
n
where?
n
is the normal stress or pressure acting at the given point on the sliding surface. The total

The limits onµ can be visualized in terms of the cone of friction. For incipient motion
outward, the total reaction force of the tube acting on the particle cannot have a downward
component since it could not be counteracted by either gravity or centrifugal force effects.
Similarly, for incipient inward motion, the reaction force of the tube on the particle cannot
have an outward component since there is no counteracting force available. In both cases,
the symmetry axis of the cone of friction is normal to the tube and passes through the axis
of rotation.

110 Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
The angle? at which slipping begins can be obtained directly by using the cone of friction.
First, note that since the disk is massless there is no resistance to angular acceleration about
the particle. Hence, there can be no applied moment about the particle. This means that the
line of action of the force at the contact point C must pass through the particle. If this line
of action lies within the cone of friction, there is no slipping. But slipping begins when?
reaches 90
?
, at which time
tan?=
1
2
r
r
=µ (2.273)
and the particle lies on the cone of friction.
Slipping will continue as long as the particle is outside the cone of friction but will end
when it re-enters the cone at
? = 90
?
+ 2?= 143.1
?
(2.274)
During the period when the particle is outside the cone of friction, the force at C must drop
to zero since the line of action of any force must pass through the particle and lie on or
within that cone. Thus, the particle moves in free fall under the action of gravity during the
slipping period, and continuously approaches the inclined plane. It is reasonable to assume
that the disk maintains contact with the plane during the free fall of the particle since
¨
? is
continuously positive and one might consider the effect of an in?nitesimal rotational inertia
about the particle.
At the instant when the particle re-enters the cone of friction, the sliding suddenly stops
and the particle velocity must be perpendicular to the cone of friction. This means that an
impulse must be applied to the particle to cause a sudden change in velocity, namely, the
velocity component toward C due to sliding must be canceled. Finally, notice that the range
of values of? over which slipping occurs turns out to be independent of the inclination
angle?.
2.5 Con?guration space and phase space
Con?guration space
In Chapter 1 we introduced the idea of con?guration space. We de?ned the con?guration
of a system to be speci?ed by the values of its n generalized coordinates. Thus, at any given
time, the con?guration is represented by a con?guration point C having a position vectorq
in an n-dimensional con?guration space or q-space. As time proceeds, the point C traces
a solution path or trajectory in con?guration space (Fig. 1.19).
If the system has m holonomic constraints of the form
?
j
(q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.275)
each constraint is represented by a surface in con?guration space on which the con?guration
point C must move. Thus, for m independent holonomic constraints, the point C is con?ned
111 Con?gurationspaceandphasespace
to the common intersection of these surfaces, which is itself a subspace of (n? m) dimen-
sions. In general, the constraint surfaces are moving, but they are ?xed if the constraints are
scleronomic of the form?
j
(q).
It is always possible to give the location of C within the constraint intersection subspace
by de?ning (n? m) new generalized coordinates which are independent and specify the
con?guration of the system. In other words, it is always possible, in theory, to ?nd a set of
(n? m) independent generalized coordinates which are consistent with the constraints and
de?ne the con?guration of a holonomic system. These independent qs can then be used in
writing equations of motion by means of Lagrange’s equations.
A virtual displacement?q which is consistent with the holonomic constraint
?
j
(q

,...,q
n
, t)= 0 (2.276)
must satisfy the instantaneous constraint equation
n
null i=1
??
j
?q
i
?q
i
= 0 (2.277)
The coef?cients of??
j
/?q
i
are components of the gradient vector which is perpendicular
to the constraint surface. Equation (2.277) states that the dot product of the gradient vector
and?q in con?guration space is equal to zero. Hence, the two vectors are orthogonal and
?q must lie in the tangent plane at the operating point C (Fig. 2.11).
Now let us suppose there are m nonholonomic constraints acting on the system. The
constraints have the general form
f
j
(q, ? q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.278)
or, in the usual linear case,
n

(q, t) ? q

+ a

(q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.279)
There are no constraint surfaces in con?guration space because the constraint equations
are not integrable. Since there are no constraint surfaces, the entire n-dimensional space
is accessible to the con?guration point C. We see that nonholonomic constraints, for any

given con?guration and time, are essentially restrictions on the possible velocities of the
system. For the common case of catastatic constraints (a
jt
= 0), the restrictions are on the
possible directions of ? q rather than on its magnitude.
Any virtual displacements of a nonholonomic system must satisfy the Chetaev equation

which is the instantaneous or virtual constraint equation. The coef?cients a
ji
represent
components of a vector associated with the jth constraint and which is normal to the
differential surface in which any virtual displacement?q must lie. By properly steering
the con?guration point C and its associated (n? m)-dimensional differential surface, it is
always kinematically possible to go between any two points of con?guration space if all
the constraints are nonholonomic and there are at least two degrees of freedom.
It is sometimes convenient to represent solution paths in an extended con?guration space
or event space of n+ 1 dimensions consisting of thenq s and time. In this space, a solution
path will never cross itself. Also, constraint surfaces corresponding to rheonomic holonomic
constraints will be ?xed rather than moving. When one considers variational methods in
dynamics, some procedures are more easily visualized in extended con?guration space.
Phase space
We have seen that Lagrange’s equations for a dynamical system are n second-order differ-
ential equations whose solutions q
i
(t) are conveniently expressed as paths in con?guration
space. For a given dynamical system, there is more than one possible path through a given
con?guration point because of the variety of possible velocities.
Now consider Hamilton’s canonical equations for a holonomic system. They are 2n ?rst-
order differential equations giving ? qs and ? ps as functions of (q, p, t). We can consider the
qs and ps together to form a 2n-vectorx= (q
1
,...,q
n
, p
1
,...,p
n
) and then the equations
of motion have the form
? x
i
= X
i
(x, t)( i = 1,...,2n) (2.282)
The motion of the system can be represented by the path of a phase point P moving in
the 2n-dimensional phase space. Note that a point in phase space speci?es not only the
con?guration but also the state of motion as represented by the ps.
Phase space is particularly convenient in presenting the possible motions of aconservative
holonomic system. In this case the Hamiltonian function is not an explicit function of time,
and the equations of motion have the form
? x
i
= X
i
(x)( i = 1,...,2n) (2.283)

=
?H(q, p)
?p
i
, ? p

=?
?H(q, p)
?q
i
(i = 1,...,2n) (2.284)
Because the system is conservative the Hamiltonian function is constant, that is
H(q, p)= h (2.285)
where h is usually evaluated from the initial conditions. This equation represents a surface
in phase space, and the corresponding trajectory must lie entirely on this surface. From
(2.283) or (2.284) we see that the direction of motion is given at all ordinary points where
the velocity is not zero. Hence, there is only one trajectory through each point, and every
trajectory is ?xed. Thus, the whole of phase space with its trajectories represents the totality
of all possible motions of a conservative system.
A point in phase space at which all the ? qs and ? ps are zero is known as an equilibrium point
or singular point. The corresponding trajectory consists of the equilibrium point only. If we
make the usual assumption that the Hamiltonian function has at least two partial derivatives
with respect to the qs and ps, it can be shown that an in?nite time is required to enter or
leave an equilibrium point. Thus, although more than one trajectory may apparently pass
through an equilibrium point, it cannot do so in a ?nite time.
As a simple example of phase space methods, consider the phase plane diagram of
Fig. 2.12 which shows the possible solution paths inqp-space for a simple pendulum. Here
q is the pendulum angle and p is the corresponding angular momentum. There is a position
of stable equilibrium at A, corresponding to? = 0. Points B and C represent unstable
equilibrium positions at?=±?.
Now suppose that solution curves are traced in a 2n-dimensional state space consisting
of thenq s and n ? qs. If one knows the state of a system at a certain initial time t
0
, then the
differential equations will determine its further motion. This is equivalent to knowing the
q

114 Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
initial values of the qs and ps in phase space. Thus, the trajectories in state space are similar
to those in phase space. In particular, the equilibrium points of conservative holonomic
systems occur at the same values of qs in both spaces.
Velocity space
The concept of velocity space is important in the analysis of nonholonomic systems. Non-
holonomic constraints are essentially constraints on the velocities ( ? qs) of a system for a
given con?guration and time, whereas holonomic constraints restrict the possible con?gu-
rations (qs) at a given time. Thus, the role of ? qs for nonholonomic constraints is similar to
that of qs for holonomic constraints.
Velocity space is the n-dimensional space of the ? qs. Nonholonomic constraints can be
represented as surfaces in velocity space, where the qs and t are regarded as parameters.
For example, consider a general nonholonomic constraint of the form
f
j
(q, ? q, t)= 0 (2.286)
which is represented as a curved surface in velocity space (Fig. 2.13).
The constraint forceC
j
is perpendicular to the constraint surface; that is, its components
are proportional to?f
j
/? ? q
i
(i = 1,...,n) which are the components of the gradient vector
in velocity space. A virtual velocity vector?w must lie in the tangent plane at the operating
point P. Therefore,?w andC

are orthogonal, implying that

Comparing (2.288) with the Chetaev expression of (2.280) for virtual displacements, we
see that the virtual velocity vector?w and the virtual displacement vector?q are constrained
to the same allowable directions in space.
Now consider the common case where there are nonholonomic constraints of the linear
form

(q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.289)

?w can be considered as a variation? ? q with q and t ?xed, and must satisfy
n
null i=1
a

(q, t)?w
i
=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.290)
Therefore, it must lie in the (n? m)-dimensional intersection of the constraint planes.
The distance d from the origin of a constraint plane in velocity space is
d =
|a
jt
|
null null i

(2.291)
We see that if the nonholonomic constraint is catastatic (a
jt
= 0), then the constraint plane
goes through the origin. In this case, if a velocity ? q satis?es the constraints, then ? q multiplied
by an arbitrary scalar constant also satis?es the constraints. Thus, for the rather common
case of catastatic constraints, the effect of nonholonomic constraints on a system is to
restrict the possible directions of ? q but not its magnitude.
When one considers conservative systems which also have catastatic nonholonomic con-
straints, there is a temptation to consider the energy integral as an additional nonholonomic
constraint. There are, however, qualitative differences between ordinary kinematic con-
straints and energy constraints. For a given con?guration and time, an energy constraint is
actually a constraint on the kinetic energy, and is represented in velocity space by a closed
116 Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
surface which surrounds the origin. This means that an energy constraint does not restrict
the direction of ? q, but for any given direction, its magnitude is speci?ed. On the other hand,
we found that linear catastatic constraints restrict the possible directions of ? q but not the
magnitude.
As a natural application of velocity space methods, let us consider the derivation of
Jourdain’s principle. We start with Lagrange’s principle as expressed in (2.33), namely,

?T
?q
i
? Q

= 0 (2.292)
where the ?qs satisfy the instantaneous constraints expressed in (2.280) or (2.281).
Lagrange’s principle applies to holonomic or nonholonomic systems and leads to (n? m)
differential equations of motion if there are m constraints. A comparison of (2.281) which
constrains the?qs in con?guration space with (2.290) which constrains the?ws in velocity
space shows that the corresponding?qs and?ws are proportional. Hence, we can substitute
?w
i
for?q
i
in (2.292). We obtain

? ? q

This is Jourdain’s principle. The variation?w is considered to take place in velocity space
at an operating point P on the common intersection of the constraint planes. By choosing
(n? m) independent sets of?ws which satisfy the constraints expressed in (2.290), one can
use Jourdain’s principle to obtain (n? m) second-order differential equations of motion.
In addition, there are m constraint equations, making a total of n equations to solve for the
nq s.
Example 2.12 Let us apply Jourdain’s principle to the nonholonomic system (Fig. 2.3)
which was studied previously in Example 2.3 on page 83. The con?guration of a dumbbell
that moves in the horizontal xy-plane is given by the generalized coordinates (x, y,?).
There is a knife-edge constraint at particle 1 which has the Cartesian coordinates (x, y),
and the relative position of particle 2 with respect to particle 1 is given by the angle?.
The nonholonomic constraint equation is
? ? x sin?+ ? y cos?= 0 (2.294)
which states that the velocity of particle 1 is limited to the longitudinal direction. Hence,
the virtual velocity components must satisfy

In this example, n= 3 and m= 1 so there are two independent sets of?ws which satisfy
(2.295). We can choose
?w= (cos?,sin?,0) (2.300)
and
?w= (0, 0, 1) (2.301)
Notice that these components of?w are not necessarily in?nitesimal.
Using Jourdain’s principle and the ?rst set of?ws, we obtain
m(2 ¨ x cos?+ 2¨ y sin?? l

which is the ?rst equation of motion. The second equation of motion is obtained by using
the second set of?ws, resulting in

These differential equations of motion are the same as those obtained by ?rst using
the nonholonomic Lagrange equations with Lagrange multipliers, and then algebraically
eliminating the?s. However, the use of Jourdain’s principle appears to be more direct.
In addition to the two equations of motion, (2.302) and (2.303), a third equation is obtained
by differentiating the constraint equation with respect to time, with the result
? ¨ x sin?+ ¨ y cos?? ? x
?
? cos?? ? y
?
? sin?= 0 (2.304)
These three equations are suf?cient to solve for x(t), y(t), and?(t).
2.6 Impulse response, analytical methods
In the previous discussion of impulse methods in Chapter 1, Newton’s law and vectorial
methods were used. In this chapter we will use the analytical methods of Hamilton and
Lagrange, and will pay particular attention to constrained systems.
Hamiltonian approach
Consider anunconstrainedsystem whose dynamical equation of motion has the Hamiltonian
form
? p
i
=?
?H
?q
i
+ Q
null i
(i = 1,...,n) (2.305)
118 Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
where Q
null i
is the ith generalized applied force which is not derived from the potential energy
portion of the Hamiltonian function.
Now let us assume that very large forces are applied to the system over an in?nitesimal
time intervalnull t, beginning at time t
1
. Let us integrate (2.305) over the intervalnull t.W e
obtain
null t 1+null t
t 1
null ? p
i
+
?H
?q
i
null dt=
null t 1+null t
t 1
Q
null i
dt (i = 1,...,n) (2.306)
The term?H/?q
i
remains ?nite during the impulse, so its integral can be neglected. Thus
we obtain
null p
i
=
ˆ
Q
i
(i = 1,...,n) (2.307)
for this unconstrained system. The generalized impulse is
ˆ
Q
i
=
null t 1+null t
t 1
Q
null i
dt (i = 1,...,n) (2.308)
and
null p
i
=
null t 1+null t
t 1
? p
i
dt=
n
null j=1
m
ij
null ? q
j
(i = 1,...,n) (2.309)
where we assume that the qs are ?xed during the impulse. Thus, thenull ? qs can be obtained
by solving
n
null j=1
m
ij
null ? q
j
=
ˆ
Q
i
(i = 1,...,n) (2.310)
as we found earlier in (1.360).
Now consider an unconstrained system of N particles whose positions are given by
the Cartesian coordinates x
1
,...x
3N
. Suppose that corresponding impulses
ˆ
F
1
,...,
ˆ
F
3N
are applied to the system during the in?nitesimal intervalnull t. The generalized impulse
associated with q
i
is
ˆ

(2.311)
in agreement with (1.359).
Lagrangian approach
Let us begin with the fundamental form of Lagrange’s equation, namely,
d
dt
null ?T
? ? q
i
null ?
?T
?q
i
= Q
i
(i = 1,...,n) (2.312)
119 Impulseresponse,analyticalmethods
where the Qs are due to the applied forces and the qs are independent. Now integrate with
respect to time over the intervalnull t. We obtain
null t 1+null t
t 1
null d
dt
null ?T
? ? q
i
null ?
?T
?q
i
null dt=
null t 1+null t
t 1
Q

Note that the integral of?T/?q
i
can be neglected and that
d
dt
null ?T
? ? q
i
null = ? p
i
(2.314)
Hence we obtain
null t 1+null t
t 1
? p
i
dt=
null t 1+null t
t 1
Q
i
dt (2.315)
or
null p
i
=
ˆ
Q
i
(i = 1,...,n) (2.316)
as before.
Constrained impulsive motion
Let us assume that the system has m constraints of the linear form
n
null i=1
a
ji
(q, t) ? q
i
+ a
jt
(q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.317)
Jourdain’s principle applies in this case, so we can write
n
null i=1
null d
dt
null ?T
? ? q
i
null ?
?T
?q
i
? Q
i
null ?w
i
= 0 (2.318)
where the virtual velocities?w
i
satisfy the instantaneous constraints, that is,
n
null i=1
a
ji
(q, t)?w
i
=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.319)
Now assume that impulsive forces are applied to the system over an in?nitesimal interval
null t, beginning at time t
1
. Integrate (2.318) with respect to time over the intervalnull t for this
impulsive case, and again note that the integral of?T/?q
i
can be neglected since it is ?nite.
We obtain
n
null i=1
[null p
i
?
ˆ
Q
i
]?w
i
= 0 (2.320)
or
n
null i=1

120 Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
where
null ? q
j
= ? q
j
? ? q
j0
(2.322)
and ? q
j
is evaluated just after the impulse whereas ? q
j0
is the initial value just before the
impulse. Finally, we can write the general equation for constrained impulsive motion which
is
n
null i=1
null n
null j=1
m
ij
( ? q
j
? ? q
j0
)?
ˆ
Q
i
null ?w
i
= 0 (2.323)
It is assumed that the con?guration and the values of the ? q
j0
s are known just before the
impulses
ˆ
Q
i
are applied. There are (n? m) independent sets of?ws which satisfy (2.319).
In addition, there are m actual constraint equations of the form
n
null i=1
a
ji
(q, t) ? q
i
+ a
jt
(q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.324)
Thus, there are a total of n equations to solve for the n ? qs immediately after the impulses
are applied. The qs remain unchanged.
Lagrange multiplier form
Instead of using virtual velocities, we can analyze constrained impulsive motion by starting
with the general equation
null p
i
=
ˆ
Q
i
+
ˆ
C
i
(i = 1,...,n) (2.325)
where
ˆ
Q
i
is the generalized applied impulse and
ˆ
C
i
is the corresponding constraint impulse.
Now, by integrating (2.47) with respect to time over the intervalnull t of the impulses, we
obtain
ˆ
C
i
=
m
null k=1
ˆ
?
k
a
ki
(i = 1,...,n) (2.326)
where
ˆ
?
k
is an impulsive Lagrangian multiplier. Thus, using (2.309), (2.325), and (2.326),
we obtain
m
null j=1
m
ij
( ? q
j
? ? q
j0
)=
ˆ
Q
i
+
m
null k=1
ˆ
?
k
a
ki
(i = 1,...,n) (2.327)
This is the Lagrange multiplier form of the constrained impulsive motion equation. These
n equations plus the m constraint equations from (2.324) are a total of (n+ m) equations to
solve for the n ? qs and the m
ˆ
?s. After ?nding the
ˆ
?s, the constraint impulses can be obtained
from (2.326).
Impulsive constraints
We have assumed that the coef?cients a
ji
and a
jt
in the constraint equations are continuous
functions of the qs and t. Now consider the case of impulsive constraints where one or more
121 Impulseresponse,analyticalmethods
of the as may be discontinuous at some time t
1
. This allows for the sudden appearance of
a constraint or a sudden change in its motion. For example, the sudden appearance of a
?xed constraint would be represented by the sudden change of the a
ji
coef?cients for that
constraint from zero to nonzero values, whereas a
jt
remains equal to zero. On the other
hand, a sudden change in a
jt
represents a change in the velocity of a moving constraint.
We shall assume that a sudden change in a constraint is not accompanied by an applied
impulse
ˆ
Q
i
at exactly the same time. Thus, we assume that
ˆ
Q
i
=0( i = 1,...,n) (2.328)
Usually the sudden change in the values of the a
ji
or a
jt
coef?cients results in
ˆ
C
i
constraint
impulses. An exception occurs when a constraint suddenly disappears, that is, when its as
suddenly go to zero. In this case, there are no constraint impulses.
In general, for impulsive constraints, (2.323) becomes
n
null i=1
n
null j=1
m
ij
( ? q
j
? ? q
j0
)?w
i
= 0 (2.329)
where the virtual velocities?w
i
satisfy (2.319). The Lagrange multiplier form, given by
(2.327), becomes
n
null j=1
m
ij
( ? q
j
? ? q
j0
)=
m
null k=1
ˆ
?
k
a
ki
(i = 1,...,n) (2.330)
When one uses (2.329) and (2.330) a question arises concerning which of the discontinuous
values of the as are to be used in the associated constraint equations. The initial velocities
? q
j0
must satisfy (2.324) where theas are evaluated att
?
1
, that is, just before the discontinuity.
On the other hand, the as are evaluated at t
+
1
for constraint equations involving ? q
j
,?w
i
, and
for the coef?cients of
ˆ
?
k
.
For the case in which a constraint suddenly disappears, we see from (2.330) that, since
there are no constraint impulses, the ? qs are continuous, that is, ? q
j
= ? q
j0
.
Example 2.13 Three particles, each of mass m, are rigidly connected in the form of
an equilateral triangle by massless rigid rods of length l (Fig. 2.15). The system moves
downward with velocityv
0
in pure translational motion and particle 1 hits a smooth ?oor
at y= 0 inelastically. We wish to solve for the velocities of the particles immediately after
impact. Assume that particle 1 is directly below particle 3 at the time of impact.
We wish to illustrate the use of the general equations (2.323) and (2.327) for this
system which has three ordinary holonomic constraints and one impulsive holonomic
constraint. Let us specify the con?guration of the system by the Cartesian coordinates
(x

These equations are valid continuously before and after the impact.
The impulsive constraint equation is
? y

= 0 (2.339)
This equation applies during and after impact, but not before.
First method Let us use impulsive Lagrange multipliers. Since all the
ˆ
Qs equal zero, we
can use (2.330). The as are the coef?cients in (2.336)–(2.339), the constraint equations
linear in the ? qs. There is no inertial coupling between these Cartesian coordinates, and
m

= m for i = j. Thus, noting that ? y

There are two independent sets of?ws which satisfy these constraint equations since
n? m= 2. Let set 1 be
?w
i
= (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0) (2.353)
124 Lagrange’sandHamilton’sequations
corresponding to uniform translation in the x-direction. We will take set 2 to be
?w
i
= (1, 0, 0,
?
3,?1, 0) (2.354)
which represents rotational motion about the midpoint of the vertical rod.
Using (2.329) with set 1, we obtain
? x

+ ? x
2
+ ? x

This is equivalent to adding (2.340), (2.342), and (2.344). Similarly, using set 2, we obtain
? x

3( ? y

= 0 (2.356)
These two equations plus the four constraint equations, namely, (2.336)–(2.339), can be
solved for the six Cartesian components of the particle velocities immediately after impact.
The results agree with (2.346).
We have used general equations for the impulse response of constrained systems of
particles. For the particular system under consideration, the analysis for its motion could
have been simpli?ed considerably if we had considered the rigidly connected particles to
be a rigid body. We will study the impulse response of rigid bodies as one of the topics in
the next chapter.

Impulsive constraints
Now let us consider energy relations in the case of impulsive constraints for which the a

or a

coef?cients suddenly change value. First consider the case of catastatic constraints
having the form
n
null i=1
a
ji
(q, t) ? q
i
=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.364)
and assume that the as are discontinuous at time t

. We assume that all

zero and start with the impulsive constraint equation in the form

= 0 (2.365)
where the?ws satisfy

?w

=0( j = 1,...,m) (2.366)
Comparing (2.364) and (2.366), we see that any ? q
i
which satis?es (2.364) at time t
+
1
will
also satisfy (2.366). Then let us take?w

= ? q

in (2.365) and note that the?wso r ? qs need
not be in?nitesimal. We obtain
n
null i=1
n
null j=1
m

( ? q

) ? q

= 0 (2.367)
The ? q

s satisfy (2.364) with the as evaluated at t
?

. From (2.367), and recalling that

( ? q

Thus, we ?nd that the loss of kinetic energy T

A simple example of an impulsive catastatic constraint is provided by the sudden appear-
ance of a ?xed frictionless constraint surface. For example, a particle might suddenly hit a
?xed wall with inelastic impact.
Now let us consider the case of impulsive constraints which are not catastatic. Speci?-
cally, let us assume that the a

This equation states that the constraint impulse
ˆ
C and the resulting change in generalized
momentum are normal to the parallel constraint planes, before and after time t
1
of the
impulse. Of course, any possible velocity ? q
0
at t
?

must lie in the constraint plane.
Another possibility would be for the a
jt
coef?cients to jump from nonzero to zero values,
corresponding to a sudden stop of moving constraints. This would reverse roles of ? q
0
and ? q
in Fig. 2.16b and the resulting change in T
2
would be a loss equal to K , the kinetic energy
of relative motion.

Kinematicsanddynamicsofarigidbody
A rigid body may be viewed as a special case of a system of particles in which the particles
are rigidly interconnected with each other. As a consequence, the basic principles which
apply to systems of particles also apply to rigid bodies. However, there are additional
kinematical and dynamical formulations which are speci?cally associated with rigid bodies,
and which contribute greatly to their analysis. This chapter will be primarily concerned with
a discussion of these topics.
3.1 Kinematical preliminaries
Degrees of freedom
Thecon?guration of a rigid body can be expressed by giving the location of an arbitrary point
in the body and also giving the orientation of the body in space. This can be accomplished
by ?rst considering a Cartesian body-axis frame to be ?xed in the rigid body with its origin
at the arbitrary reference point for the body. The location of the origin of this xyz body-axis
frame can be given by the values of three Cartesian coordinates relative to an inertial XYZ
frame. The orientation of the rigid body is speci?ed by giving the orientation of the body
axes relative to the inertial frame. This relative orientation is frequently expressed in terms
of three independent Euler angles which will be de?ned.
The number of degrees of freedom of a rigid body is equal to the number of independent
parameters required to specify its con?guration which, in effect, speci?es the locations of all
the particles comprising the body. In this case, there are three Cartesian coordinates and three
Euler angles, so there are six degrees of freedom for the rigid body. Alternative methods are
available for specifying the orientation, but in each case the number of parameters minus the
number of independent constraining relationships is equal to three, the number of degrees of
freedom associated with orientation. To summarize, a rigid body has six degrees of freedom,

The matrix C is called a rotation matrix and it speci?es the relative orientation of the two
coordinate systems. An element c
i
null j
is equal to the cosine of the angle between the positive
i
  andj axes, and is called a direction cosine. By convention, the ?rst subscript refers to the
?nal coordinate system, and the second subscript refers to the original coordinate system.
In order to transform a given set of components to a new coordinate system, premultiply by
the corresponding rotation matrix.
In general, the nine elements of a rotation matrix are all different. The ?rst column of the
C matrix gives the components of the unit vectori in the primed frame. Similarly, the second
142 Kinematicsanddynamicsofarigidbody
and third columns of C representj andk respectively, in the primed frame. Hence, the sum
of the squares of the elements of a single column must equal one. In other words, the scalar
product of a unit vector with itself must equal one. On the other hand, the scalar product of
any two different columns must equal zero, since the unit vectors are mutually orthogonal.
Altogether, there are three independent equations for single columns, and three independent
equations for pairs of columns, giving a total of six independent constraining equations. The
number of direction cosines (nine) minus the number of independent constraining equations
(six) yields three, the number of rotational degrees of freedom.
By interchanging primed and unprimed subscripts, we see that the transposed rotation
matrixC
T
is the rotation matrix for the transformation from the primed frame to the unprimed
frame. Hence, the sequence of transformations C and C
T
, in either order, will return a
coordinate frame to its original orientation. We ?nd that

The order of matrix multiplications is important, indicating that the order of the correspond-
ing ?nite rotations is also important. As we shall see, the de?nitions of the various Euler
angle systems used in specifying rigid body orientations always require a particular order
in making the rotations.
Euler angles
The rotation of a rigid body from some reference orientation to an arbitrary ?nal orientation
can always be accomplished by three rotations in a given sequence about speci?ed body
axes. The resulting angles of rotation are known as Euler angles. Many Euler angle systems
are possible, but we will consider only two, namely, aircraft Euler angles and classical Euler
angles.
Type I (aircraft) Euler angles are shown in Fig. 3.2 and represent an axis-of-rotation
order zyx, where each successive rotation is about the latest position of the given body
axis. Assume that the xyz body axes and the XYZ inertial axes coincide initially. Then three

rotations are made in the following order: (1)? about the Z-axis, resulting in the primed

? and? are unde?ned, but (???) is the angle between the Y and y axes.
All types of Euler angle systems are subject to singularity problems which occur when
two of the Euler angle rates represent rotations about the same axis in space. Thus, in
Fig. 3.2 the
?
? and
?
? rotations occur about the same vertical axis if?=±?/2. When
combined with a
?
? rotation about a horizontal axis, this limits the? vector to a de?nite
vertical plane when using this Euler angle representation, even though the actual motion
may have no such constraint. For these reasons and the associated problems of maintain-
ing accuracy in numerical computations, it is the usual practice to choose an Euler angle
system such that the rotational motion of the rigid body does not come near a singular
orientation.
Type II Euler angles are shown in Fig. 3.3. The order of rotation is as follows: (1)? about
the Z-axis; (2)? about the x

147 Kinematicalpreliminaries
Euler angles are true generalized coordinates and, as such, can be used asqs in Lagrange’s
equations. We shall ?nd, however, that other methods may be more convenient in obtaining
the dynamical equations for the rotational motion of a rigid body.
Axis and angle of rotation
An important result in rigid body kinematics is expressed by Euler’s Theorem: The most
general displacement of a rigid body with a ?xed point is equivalent to a single rotation
about some axis through that point.
Because a ?xed point is assumed, any motion involves a change of orientation. Hence,
Euler’s theorem is concerned with orientation changes. On the basis of this theorem, we
conclude that, although any Euler angle system expresses an orientation change in terms of
a sequence of three rotations about coordinate axes, the same change of orientation could
have been obtained by a single rotation about a ?xed axis. Hence, if one can specify the
direction of the axis of rotation, as well as the angle of rotation about this axis, it is equivalent
to specifying three Euler angles or a rotation matrix consisting of nine direction cosines.
Suppose we let the direction of the axis of rotation be given by the unit vector
a= a
x
i+ a
y
j+ a
z
k (3.25)
wherei, j, k are Cartesian unit vectors and the scalar as are constrained by the relation
a
2
x
+ a
2
y
+ a
2
z
= 1 (3.26)
These ash a v et h esame values in either the inertial or the body-?xed frame, and remain
constant during the rotation because the rotation axis is ?xed in both frames. Let? be the
angle of rotation of the body-?xed frame relative to the inertial frame, where positive? is
measured in a right-hand sense about the unit vector a. The values of the four parameters
(a
x
,a
y
,a
z
,?) specify the orientation of the rigid body and its body-?xed frame. These are
the axis and angle variables.
Now suppose that we are given a rotation matrix C and we desire the corresponding
values of the axis and angle variables. First, the angle of rotation? is found from the trace
of the rotation matrix, that is,
trC = c
xx
+ c
yy
+ c
zz
= 1+ 2 cos?, 0???? (3.27)
Then, knowing?, we can ?nd the direction cosines of the axis of rotation from

For convenience, the primes have been dropped from the subscripts of the cs. Note that
the limits on? given in (3.27) imply that sin? is positive or zero. This is always possible
148 Kinematicsanddynamicsofarigidbody
because a rotation? is equivalent to a rotation (2???) about an oppositely directed
a axis.
If the value of? is near 0 or?, then| sin?|<< 1 and (3.28) leads to inaccurate results.
In this case, better accuracy can be obtained by using

A comparison of (3.28) and (3.29) shows that
sin?=

d (3.30)
For values of? near 0 or?, this equation is more accurate than (3.27) in determining?.
Note that (3.27) uses the main diagonal terms of C to evaluate?, whereas (3.30) uses the
off-diagonal terms. For these small positive values of sin?, (3.27) is used to determine the
quadrant.
Now consider the case in which the axis and angle variables are given, and we wish to
?nd the corresponding rotation matrix. First, let us write the rotation matrix C as the sum
of its symmetric and antisymmetric parts.
C = C
s

The symmetric matrix is

and the antisymmetric (or skew-symmetric) matrix is

Euler parameters
Another method of specifying the orientation of a rigid body is by the use of four Euler

closely related to axis and angle variables. We shall de?ne the Euler parameters in terms of

Euler parameters have the advantages of having no singular orientations and only one

Successive rotations
In the earlier discussion of rotation matrices, we found that successive rotations of a co-
ordinate frame are accomplished by successive premultiplications by the corresponding
rotation matrices. The question arises whether a similar procedure is available for use with
Euler parameters. The answer is that such a procedure is indeed available, and consists in
premultiplying the current Euler 4-vector by the matrix

Angular velocity
Consider the rotation matrix which gives the orientation of a body-?xed xyz frame relative
to an inertial XYZ frame. Let (i,j,k) be the unit vectors for the xyz frame and let (I,J,K)
be the corresponding unit vectors for the inertial frame. Then we can write
C =

It is important to realize that the order of the in?nitesimal rotations does not matter,

Instantaneous axis of rotation
Euler’s theorem states that the most general displacement of a rigid body with a ?xed base
point is equivalent to a single rotation about some axis through that point. A completely
general displacement of a rigid body, however, would require a displacement of all points in
the body. So, if one is given a base point ?xed in the body, then the most general displacement
is equivalent to (1) a translation of the body resulting in the correct ?nal position of the
base point, followed by (2) a rotation about an axis through the ?nal position of the base
point which gives the correct ?nal orientation. Now, for a given base point, it is apparent
that the translation and rotation are independent and can take place in any order or possibly
together. Furthermore, for any nonzero rotation angle? and a given axis orientation, it is
always possible to choose a location of the axis of rotation such that any given base point
in the body will undergo a prescribed translation in a plane perpendicular to the axis of
rotation. Hence, all that remains is to give the base point the required translation parallel
to the axis of rotation. Thus we obtain Chasles’ Theorem: The most general displacement
of a rigid body is equivalent to a screw displacement consisting of a rotation about a ?xed
axis plus a translation parallel to that axis.
Now suppose that a rigid body undergoes a general in?nitesimal displacement during
the time intervalnull t. Then, in accordance with Chasles’ theorem, the motion in the limit as
null t approaches zero can be considered as the superposition of an angular velocity? about
some axis plus a translational velocityv in a direction parallel to?. All points in the body
that lie on this axis have the same velocityv along the axis. This axis exists for all cases in
which?null 0 and is known as the instantaneous axis of rotation.
For the special case of planar motion, the velocity v is equal to zero; and the in-
stantaneous axis becomes the instantaneous center of rotation. The instantaneous axis
of rotation, or the instantaneous center for planar motion, can move relative to the
body and relative to inertial space. However, at the instant under consideration these
points in the rigid body have no velocity component normal to the instantaneous axis of
rotation.
Example 3.1 A solid cone of semivertex angle 30
?
rolls without slipping on the inside
surface of a conical cavity with a semivertex angle at O equal to 60
?
(Fig. 3.4). The cone
has an angular velocity? with a constant magnitude?
0
. We wish to determine the values
of the Euler angles, axis and angle variables, Euler parameters, and their rates of change
when the con?guration is as shown in the ?gure.
Let us use Type II Euler angles. The three successive rotations about the Z, x, and z
axes, respectively, are?= 0,? = 30
?
, and? = 0. From (3.24), or directly by observation
of Fig. 3.4, we ?nd that the rotation matrix is

Next, consider axis and angle variables, where? is now the rotation angle about the

3.2 Dyadic notation
De?nition of a dyadic
Dyadics are used in vector equations to represent the second-order tensors that are often
expressed as 3× 3 matrices. A dyad consists of a pair of vectors such as ab written in a
particular order. A dyadic is the sum of dyads.
160 Kinematicsanddynamicsofarigidbody
Each vector in 3-space may be expressed in terms of an orthogonal set of unit vectors. If
we choose the same set of unit vectors fora andb, we obtain
a= a

Dyadic operations
In general, the order of the dot product of a dyadic and a vector is important, that is,
A·bnull b·A (3.118)
161 Dyadicnotation
for an arbitrary vector b. On the other hand, for a symmetric dyadic such as the inertia
dyadicI, we ?nd that
I·?=?·I= H (3.119)
where? is an arbitrary angular velocity andH is the angular momentum about the origin of
the body-axis frame. Notice that the dot product of a vector and a dyadic results in a vector
having a different magnitude and direction, in general.
The cross product of a dyadic and a vector results in another dyadic. Again, the order is
important, that is,
A×bnull b×A (3.120)
in general.
The de?ning equation for a unit dyadic is
U= ii+jj+kk (3.121)
where one can use any orthogonal set of unit vectors. For an arbitrary vectorb we see that
U·b= b·U= b (3.122)
A de?ning equation for the inertia dyadic of a rigid body is
I=
null [(?·?)U???]dm (3.123)
where?= xi+ yj+ zk is the position vector of the mass elementdm relative to the origin
of the body axes.
Consider next the time derivative of a dyadic. As an example, suppose a rigid body has
an angular velocity?. Its inertia dyadic is
I=

null i=1
3
null j=1
I
ij
e

The ?rst subscript and unit vector in each term refer to an axis of the new primed coordinate
system after rotation, while the second subscript and unit vector refer to an axis of the

and

3.3 Basic rigid body dynamics
Kinetic energy
In accordance with Koenig’s theorem, the kinetic energy of a rigid body is equal to the sum
of (1) the kinetic energy due to the translational velocity of the center of mass and (2) the
kinetic energy due to rotation about the center of mass. Thus,
T = T

rigid bodies can be shown by considering the physical double pendulum of Fig. 3.6. Two
identical rigid bodies, supported by joints at A and B, move with planar motion. The bodies
each have mass m, length l, and moment of inertia I
c
about the center of mass.

This result agrees with that obtained earlier in (3.145) but the use of (3.146) is somewhat
more direct. Thus, it is sometimes advantageous to use a reference point which is not at the
center of mass.
The kinetic energy expression can be used to ?nd the inertia coef?cients. They are given

is equal to the moment of inertia about A due to the ?rst body plus the mass of
the second body considered as a particle at B. Furthermore, m

is the moment of inertia
of the second body about its reference point B.
Now let us consider the case illustrated in Fig. 3.6b in which?

is equal to the moment of inertia of the second body about B.
Vectorial dynamics, Euler equations
The translational equation of motion for a rigid body has the vector form
ma= F (3.155)
wherea is the acceleration of the center of mass andF is the total force acting on the body,
including any constraint forces. For a given total force acting on the body, this equation has
the same form as if the total mass m were concentrated as a particle at the center of mass.
Most of our attention, however, will be given to the rotational motion of a rigid body. A
fruitful approach is to use the vector equation
?
H= M (3.156)
166 Kinematicsanddynamicsofarigidbody
which applies if the reference point for the angular momentumH and the total momentM
acting on the body is either (1) ?xed or (2) at the center of mass. Let us choose a body-?xed
coordinate system and let the reference point be at the origin O. The angular momentum is
H= I·? (3.157)

These equations apply for an arbitrary orientation of the body axes relative to the rigid body.
Equations (3.161) or (3.162) can also be written in the matrix form
I ? ?+ ˜ ?I?= M (3.163)
where ˜ ? is given by (3.61) and represents the cross product of?.
Usually it is convenient to choose body axes which are also principal axes. Then the
products of inertia vanish and we obtain the familiar Euler equations:

Here the reference point for H and M is the origin O of the body-?xed frame, and this
point is located at the center of mass or at an inertially ?xed point. If the applied moments
are known, these nonlinear ?rst-order differential equations can be integrated numerically
167 Basicrigidbodydynamics
to give the? components as functions of time. To obtain the orientation as a function of
time, the?s are substituted into the kinematic equations (3.16) or (3.19) or (3.80), and these
are integrated numerically to give Euler angles or Euler parameters as functions of time.
As an extension of this vectorial approach to the rotational dynamics of a rigid body, let
us consider the case of a reference point P which is ?xed in the body, but it is neither at
the center of mass nor at a ?xed point in space. The angular momentum with respect to
P is
H
p
= I
p

where I
p
is the inertia dyadic of the rigid body about P. The equation of motion corre-
sponding to (3.156) is
?
H
p

p
??
c
× m ? v
p
(3.166)
in agreement with (1.115) which was obtained for a system of particles. The last term of
(3.166) can be interpreted as the moment about P due to an inertia force ?m ? v
p
acting
through the center of mass, and due to the acceleration of the reference point. Thus we
obtain
I

(3.167)
This result may be regarded as an extension of Euler’s equation for the case of an accelerating
reference point.
In general, the angular momentum H
p
about an arbitrary reference point P is equal to
the angular momentumH
c
about the center of mass plus the angular momentum due to the
translational velocity of the center of mass relative to the reference point. For this case in
which the reference point P is ?xed in the rigid body, we have (see Fig. 3.5)

Ellipsoidof inertia
Consider the kinetic energy of a rigid body rotating about a ?xed reference point. It is,
similar to (3.139),
T =
1
2
?·I·? (3.174)
whereI is the inertia dyadic about the reference point and? is the angular velocity vector.
An alternate expression for the kinetic energy due to rotation about a ?xed reference point
is
T =
1
2
I?
2
(3.175)
where the scalar I is the moment of inertia about the axis of rotation and? is the magnitude
of the angular velocity. This is apparent from (3.174) for the case where? is directed along
one of the coordinate axes.
From (3.174) and (3.175) we obtain

We see that? has the same direction as? and a magnitude that is inversely proportional to
?

of the body-?xed frame to the point (x, y, z), that is,

This is the equation of an ellipsoidal surface and is known as the ellipsoid of inertia.
The ellipsoid of inertia is ?xed relative to the rigid body and the body-?xed frame. It is
169 Basicrigidbodydynamics
essentially a three-dimensional plot which gives the value of 1/
?
I for any axis passing
through the origin of the xyz frame. The major axis is the axis having the minimum moment
of inertia. Similarly, the minor axis is the axis having the maximum moment of inertia; it
is perpendicular to the major axis. These two axes plus an orthogonal third axis constitute
the set of three principal axes corresponding to the principal moments of inertia. The
orientations of the three principal axes are such that all products of inertia are equal to zero.
This means that the inertial coupling terms associated with products of inertia dissappear
and, for example, the generalized Euler equations (3.162) simplify to the standard equations
of (3.164).
Suppose we are given a general inertia dyadic I and we wish to calculate the principal
moments of inertia of the body. If a rigid body is rotating about a principal axis, then its
angular velocity and angular momentum are parallel, that is
H= I·?= I? (3.181)
where the proportionality constant I on the right is a principal moment of inertia.
Equation (3.181) has the form of an eigenvalue problem. In terms of dyadics we have

This determinant yields a cubic equation in I known as the characteristic equation. Its three
real roots are the three principal moments of inertia.
For each root I the direction of the corresponding principal axis is found by solving
(3.183) for the ratios of the components of?. These axes are also the principal axes of the
inertia ellipsoid of the body.

Modi?ed Euler equations
Sometimes it is convenient to use a rotational equation having a form similar to (3.161)
but being different in that strict body axes are not used. In general, suppose that H and M
171 Basicrigidbodydynamics
are expressed in terms of unit vectors associated with a Cartesian frame having an angular
velocity?
c
. Then the rotational equation has the vector form
(
?
H)
r
+?
c
×H= M (3.192)
where (
?
H)
r
is the time derivative of total angular momentumH , as viewed from the rotating
frame and assuming that the unit vectors ?xed in this frame have time derivatives equal to
zero.
An important application of this approach occurs in the case of an axially symmetric
rigid body. Let us assume that the x- a x i so fa nxyz frame is the axis of symmetry, and the
reference point is chosen at the center of mass or at an inertially ?xed point on the axis
of symmetry. Let I
a
be the moment of inertia about the symmetry axis, whereas I
t
is the
moment of inertia about any transverse axis at the reference point.
Now suppose that the body rotates about the axis of symmetry with an angular velocity
or spin rate s measured relative to the xyz frame. If we let the angular velocity of the xyz
frame be
?
c

x

we see that the angular momentum of the body is

Until now the relative spin s has been arbitrary. For example, if we set s= 0, the modi?ed
Euler equations revert to ordinary Euler equations for an axially symmetric body. But we
can choose s in such a way that the kinematics of solving for the orientation of axially
symmetric body is relatively easy. Let us use type I Euler angles and let? and? specify
the orientation of the xyz frame. The inertial XYZ frame is chosen so that the XY-plane is
horizontal and the Z-axis is positive downward. Since the third Euler angle? does not
affect the orientation of the xyz frame, its y-axis remains horizontal. This implies that the
horizontal component of?
c
must lie along the y-axis, and we have the constraint equation

These three ?rst-order dynamical equations plus the three ?rst-order kinematical equations

time. Thus, we have obtained relatively simple equations for the rotational motion of an
173 Basicrigidbodydynamics
axially-symmetric body. Note that the third terms in (3.204) and (3.205) are gyroscopic
coupling terms.

These three second-order dynamical equations are somewhat more complicated than those
obtained earlier in (3.203)–(3.205).
Finally, let us consider the rather common situation in which there is no applied moment
about the axis of symmetry, that is,
M
x
= 0 (3.212)

are known as functions of (?,?,t),
these dynamic equations plus the kinematic equations (3.200) and (3.201) can be integrated
numerically to give the orientation of the axis of symmetry as a function of time.
Example3.4 As an example of an axially symmetric body with no moment applied about
its axis of symmetry, consider the motion of a top with a ?xed point under the action of
gravity (Fig. 3.8). The top has a constant total spinnull and its center of mass lies at distance
l from its ?xed point O.

Lagrange’s equations
The various forms of Lagrange’s equations such as (2.34), (2.37) and (2.49) are all useful
in obtaining equations of motion for a system involving one or more rigid bodies. There are
restrictions, however, on the use of Lagrange’s equations.
The ?rst restriction is that a complete set of qs and ? qs must be used in writing the energy
functions T and V . This means that the chosen set of generalized coordinates must be able
to specify the con?guration of the system, thereby specifying the locations of all particles
and mass elements of the system.
177 Basicrigidbodydynamics
As an example, suppose we wish to use type I Euler angles as generalized coordinates in
the Lagrangian analysis of the rotational motion of an axially-symmetric body having no
applied moment about the axis of symmetry. The rotational kinetic energy can be written
in the form
T =
1
2
I
a
null 2
+
1
2
I
t
(
?
?
2
+
?
?
2
cos
2
?) (3.241)
where the moments of inertia are taken about the center of mass and the total spinnull is
constant. Let us apply Lagrange’s equation in the fundamental form
d
dt
null ?T
? ? q
i
null ?
?T
?q
i
= Q
i
(3.242)
where the qs are the Euler angles (?,?,?). If we assume that neither Q
?
nor Q
?
are
functions of? or
?
?, then it appears that the? and? equations can be solved separately,
treatingnull as a constant in the differentiations, and effectively reducing the number of
degrees of freedom to two.
This application of Lagrange’s equation would be incorrect, however, because the system
actually has three rotational degrees of freedom, but the third Euler angle? has not entered
the analysis. Thus, we have not used a complete set of generalized coordinates. A correct
approach would be to substitute
null =
?
??
?
? sin? (3.243)
into (3.241) and obtain
T =
1

2

2
I

(

?) (3.244)
The use of this kinetic energy function in Lagrange’s equation (3.242) leads to correct
equations of motion. An alternate approach would be to notice that? is an ignorable
coordinate and use the Routhian method.
The second restriction on the use of Lagrange’s equation in a form such as (3.242) is
that true ? qs must be used in writing the kinetic energy T (q, ? q, t), rather than using quasi-
velocities as velocity variables. A quasi-velocity u
j
is equal to a linear function of the ? qs
and has the form
u
j
=
n
null i=1
null ji
(q, t)? q
i
+null jt
(q, t)( j = 1,...,n) (3.245)
where the right-hand side is not integrable.
A common example of quasi-velocities would be the body-axis components?
x
,?
y
,?
z
of
the angular velocity? of a rigid body. In terms of Euler angles, which are true coordinates,
we have
?
x

?

? cos? sin?+
?
? cos? (3.246)
?
z
=
?
? cos? cos??
?
? sin?
178 Kinematicsanddynamicsofarigidbody
and we see that the right-hand sides are not integrable. Assuming principal axes, the kinetic
energy due to rotation about the center of mass of a rigid body is
T =
1

(3.247)
However, a substitution into Lagrange’s equation (3.242), treating the?sa s? qs, does not
result in correct equations of motion. Terms are missing. Thus, the correct Euler equations
of motion are not obtained by using Lagrange’s equation. It is possible, however, to expand
the Lagrange formulation to include the required terms. This is a topic to be discussed in
the next chapter.
Example 3.6 Let us obtain the differential equations for the rotational motion of a rigid
body, using type I Euler angles as generalized coordinates. We choose the center of mass as
the reference point and thereby decouple the translational and rotational motions. Assume
a principal axis system and arbitrary applied moments.
The rotational kinetic energy is found by substituting from (3.246) into (3.247) with the
result that

The three second-order differential equations given in (3.253) are relatively complicated.
Furthermore, they must be solved for the individual accelerations
¨
?,
¨
?, and
¨
? before being
integrated numerically. This involves an inversion of the mass matrix m. By comparison,
the use of the three ?rst-order Euler equations given in (3.164) to solve for?
x
,?
y
, and?
z
,
followed by the three ?rst-order kinematic equations of (3.16) to obtain the Euler angles?,
?, and?, appears to be much simpler.
The use of type II Euler angles and Lagrange’s equation would result in equally compli-
cated equations of motion.
Angular velocity coef?cients
The state of motion of the ith rigid body can be expressed by giving the velocity v
i
of a
reference point P
i
?xed in the body and also giving its angular velocity?
i
. In terms of ? qs,
180 Kinematicsanddynamicsofarigidbody
the velocityv
i
can be written in the form
v
i
=
n
null j=1
?
ij
(q, t)? q
j
+?
it
(q, t) (3.256)
as in (1.43). The?s are calledvelocitycoef?cients and, in particular,?
ij
is a vector coef?cient
representing the sensitivity of the reference point velocityv
i
to changes in ? q
j
.
In a similar manner, the angular velocity?
i
of the ith body can be expressed as
?
i
=
n
null j=1
?
ij
(q, t)? q
j
+?
it
(q, t) (3.257)
where the?s are called angular velocity coef?cients.
We see that
?
ij
=
?v
i
? ? q
j
(3.258)
and
?
ij
=
??
i
? ? q
j
(3.259)
Furthermore, for the case of a scleronomic system, we ?nd that all?
it
and all?
it
are equal
to zero.
Now, let us consider virtual work as it applies to a rigid body. An arbitrary set of forces
acting on the ith body is dynamically equivalent to a total force F
i
acting at the reference
point plus a couple of momentM
i
which may be applied anywhere on the body. The virtual
work of this force system due to an arbitrary virtual displacement is
?W
i
= F
i
·?r
i
+M
i
·??
i
(3.260)
where?r

As an illustration of the meaning of the ?s in (3.266), consider a rigid body whose
orientation is given by three Euler angles, as in Example 3.6 on page 178. Referring to
(3.255), we see that
?

?
(3.267)
where the es are unit vectors in the directions of the respective rotation axes. In general,
however, the angular velocity coef?cients need not be of unit magnitude.
We have de?ned the velocity coef?cients and angular velocity coef?cients with respect to
true velocities (? qs), but one can also de?ne these coef?cients with respect toquasi-velocities.
Thus, when using quasi-velocities (us) as velocity variables, we write
?

The generalized force Q

is given by (3.266) where the?s and?sa r e

If the velocity variables are a mixture of quasi-velocities and true velocities, one can use
quasi-velocity notation and identify some of the us with ? qs as a special case of (3.245).
Free rotational motion
The rotational motion of a rigid body is free if the system of applied forces results in a
zero moment about the reference point which is inertially ?xed or at the center of mass.
Our approach to solving for the free rotational motion will be to use integrals of the motion
directly, rather than starting with second-order differential equations.
Let us represent the orientation of the body by type II Euler angles (Fig. 3.3). Since there
are no applied moments, the angular momentum is constant in magnitude and direction. Let
182 Kinematicsanddynamicsofarigidbody
us de?ne the vertical direction as the direction of theH vector, that is,H can be considered
to lie along the positive Z-axis. Then, assuming that the xyz body axes are principal axes,
we see from the geometry that
H

?
y

free motion so that the total spinnull is always positive or zero.
Notice that, since? is constant, the symmetry axis will sweep out a conical surface as it
precesses about the H vector which lies on the Z-axis. This is called a coning motion and
is typical of the free rotational motion of an axially-symmetric body.
The Poinsot method
The Poinsot method is a geometrical method of representing the free rotational motion of
a rigid body. It is exact and is based upon the conservation of angular momentum and of
kinetic energy.
Let us choose a set of principal axes at the center of mass as the xyz body-?xed frame.
Then, if I
1
, I
2
, and I
3
are the principal moments of inertia, (3.180) representing the ellipsoid
of inertia reduces to

The Poinsot construction (Fig. 3.9) pictures the free rotational motion of a rigid body
as the rolling of its ellipsoid of inertia on an invariable plane which is perpendicular to
the constant angular momentum vector H drawn from the ?xed center O. To see how this
comes about, recall from (3.178) that the vector? from O to P is
?=

(3.291)
which is constant as P moves. This means that the point P moves in a plane that is
perpendicular to the angular momentum vectorH and intersects it at S. This plane is ?xed
in space and is known as the invariable plane.
Next, we need to show that the invariable plane is tangent to the inertia ellipsoid at P.
The ellipsoid has the form

that is,? and? have the same direction in space. We conclude that the invariable plane is
tangent to the inertia ellipsoid at P. The instantaneous axis of rotation passes through the
contact point P, so the ellipsoid of inertia rolls without slipping on the invariable plane.
Because ? has a component normal to the invariable plane, there is also some pivoting
about P. Of course, the actual rigid body goes through the same rotational motions as the
ellipsoid of inertia.
It is interesting to consider the path of the contact point P on both the invariable plane
and the inertia ellipsoid. The path of P on the invariable plane is called the herpolhode.I t
is not a closed curve, in general, as P moves continuously between two circles centered on
S and corresponding to extreme values of (???). During successive intervals of?/2i n
?, P moves from tangency with one circle to tangency with the other.
The curve traced by P on the ellipsoid of inertia is called a polhode. For any rotation
not exactly about a principal axis, the polhode curves are closed and encircle either the
axis of minimum moment of inertia Ok or the axis of maximum moment of inertia On
(Fig. 3.10).
The polhode curves are formed by the intersection of two ellipsoids, namely, the inertia
ellipsoid and the momentum ellipsoid. The inertia ellipsoid relative to principal axes was
given by (3.288). To obtain the momentum ellipsoid we start with the expression for the
square of the angular momentum.

are constants which are usually evaluated from the initial conditions.
The polhode curve for a given case of free rotational motion is determined by the values of
(x, y, z) satisfying the initial value of? as well as (3.288) and (3.298). It can be shown that
if D< I
2
, assuming I
1
< I
2
< I
3
, the polhode encircles the axis Ok corresponding to the
minimum moment of inertia. If D> I
2
, the polhode encircles the axis On corresponding
to the maximum moment of inertia.
Now consider the stability of rotational motion about a principal axis. The polhodes in
the vicinity of k and n are tiny ellipses indicating stability, that is, a small displacement
of the axis of rotation relative to the body will remain small. On the other hand, polhodes
near m are hyperbolic in nature, indicating instability. The axis of rotation relative to the
body will suddenly ?ip over to nearly the opposite direction and then return back again,
only to repeat the cycle. Meanwhile the angular momentum vector H remains constant in
space. Thus the rotational motion of the body in space is quite irregular. In theory it takes
an in?nite time for the point P to leave m but, practically speaking, there are enough small
disturbances that the instability of rotational motion about the intermediate axis Om is
immediately apparent.
The above analysis has assumed an ideal rigid body without internal losses. However,
an actual body will have structural damping with some energy loss due to slight elastic
de?ections during the motion. As a result, there will be a decline in kinetic energy consistent
with the constant angular momentum. Finally, there will be a steady rotational motion about
the axis On corresponding to the maximum moment of inertia and minimum kinetic energy.
This explains why a spin-stabilized rigid body in space must rotate about its axis of maximum
moment of inertia.
Axial symmetry
Now assume an axially-symmetric rigid body is undergoing free rotational motion. In this
case the inertia ellipsoid is an ellipsoid of revolution and the polhodes are circles centered
on the axis of symmetry. First consider the case in which Ok of Fig. 3.10 is the axis of
symmetry and I
1
= I
a
, I
2
= I

t
and I
a
< I
t
, that is, the axis of symmetry corresponds
to the minimum moment of inertia. The inertia ellipsoid is a prolate spheroid and, as it rolls
on the invariable plane, the? vector sweeps out a cone relative to the body and also a cone
in space. This is conveniently represented by a body cone rolling on the outside of a ?xed
space cone (Fig. 3.11a). Notice that the symmetry axis Oz and the angular velocity vector

? lie on the same side of the angular momentum vector H. Also the precession rate
?
? is
smaller than?.
If, on the other hand, the axis of symmetry corresponds to the maximum moment of
inertia, the inertia ellipsoid is an oblate spheroid and we can take I
1
= I
2
= I
t
, I

a
with I
a
> I
t
. Again the polhodes are circles and, in this case, the axis of symmetry is On.
Because of the oblateness, the symmetry axis and the? vector lie on opposite sides of the
H vector. This leads to the rolling cone model shown in Fig. 3.11b in which the inside of
the body cone rolls on the outside of the ?xed space cone. Usually the precession rate
?
?
188 Kinematicsanddynamicsofarigidbody
is larger than?. In both the prolate and oblate cases the rolling cone model gives an exact
representation of the free rotational motion of an axially symmetric body.
From Fig. 3.11 we see that, for a given angular velocity?, the precession rate
?
? for the
prolate case is smaller than for the oblate case. Furthermore, notice that the relative spin
rate
?
? is positive, that is, in the direction of the symmetry axis Oz for the prolate case but
?
? is negative for an oblate body. This is in agreement with (3.287).
3.4 Impulsive motion
Planar rigid body motion
Let us begin with the relatively simple case of the planar impulsive response of a rigid
body. Suppose an impulse
ˆ
F is applied to a rigid body along one of its principal planes.
The response will be the same as if
ˆ
F were applied to a lamina having the same mass m
and moment of inertia I about the center of mass C (Fig. 3.12).
Assume that the lamina is initially motionless. An impulse
ˆ
F is applied with a line of
action through B and perpendicular to the line AB that passes through the center of mass.
The principle of linear impulse and momentum is used to obtain the velocityv of the center

(3.299)
Similarly, from the principle of angular impulse and momentum, we obtain the angular
velocity
?=
b
ˆ
F
I
(3.300)
where I is the moment of inertia about the center of mass.
Now consider the conditions on the lengths a and b such that point A is the instantaneous
center of rotation immediately after the impulse
ˆ
F is applied, that is, its velocity is zero.
This requires that
v? a?= 0
or

or
ab=

m

c
(3.301)
where k

is the radius of gyration about the center of mass.
If point A is ?xed during the impulse, then there will be no impulsive reaction at A if the
values of a and b satisfy (3.301). Under these conditions, the point B is known as the center
of percussion relative to A. Similarly, point A is the center of percussion relative to B.
Example 3.7 Let us solve for the height h at which a billiard ball must be struck by a
horizontal impulse in order that the response will be pure rolling with no tendency to slip
(Fig. 3.13).

This second method is, in effect, a method for taking linear combinations of the n equa-
tions of the form of (3.310) in such a manner that the
ˆ
?s are eliminated. Thus, a reduced set
of equations is obtained from which one can solve for the ?nal ? qs.
Quasi-velocities
In the discussion of the use of Lagrange’s equations in rigid body dynamics, it was mentioned
that quasi-velocities (us) as de?ned in (3.245) cannot be used in the expression for kinetic
energy. Rather, the kinetic energy, in general, must have the form T (q, ? q, t) where the ? qs
are true velocities in the sense that they are time derivatives of parameters which specify the
con?guration of the system. On the other hand, the body-axis components?
x
,?
y
and?
z
are
quasi-velocities whose time integrals do not specify the orientation of a rigid body. Thus,
kinetic energy written as T (q,?,t) cannot be used in Lagrange’s equation. This restriction,
however, does not apply to impulsive equations. Thus, (3.305) can be generalized to

Example 3.9 A rigid body is moving with general motion when suddenly its reference

not impeded. We wish to ?nd the angular velocity of the body immediately after application
of this impulsive constraint.

and these velocities occur just before the reference point P undergoes inelastic impact with

where the I s are taken about the reference point P.
Second method Let us choose the ?xed origin O as the ?nal location of the reference
point P. There is conservation of angular momentum about O because the only impulse
applied to the rigid body acts through that point.
First, we need to ?nd the angular momentum about O in terms of the angular momentum
about P. From Fig. 3.5 we see that, in general,
H

c
·?+ m(r

is the inertia dyadic about the center of mass. The angular momentum about P is
H

Hence, we ?nd that

c

(3.357)
This equation would be valid even if the point O were moving since the de?nition of angular
momentum involves relative velocities.
For this example, the point O is ?xed and, at the time of impact, r
p
= 0. Just before
impact,
? r

Thus, the angular momentum about O at this time, as given by (3.357), is

in agreement with (3.352)–(3.354). Thus, we see that the conservation of angular momentum
approach is rather direct in this case.

For the general case in which the motion of a mechanical system is expressed in terms of
quasi-velocities, we found that

in the Lagrange multiplier form

(3.366)
All impulses occur at the same instant.
A comparison of (3.365) with (3.308) shows that equations of the same form apply
whether we use ? qso rus as velocity variables. Furthermore, the constraints may be holo-
nomic or nonholonomic and, in either case, it is always possible to ?nd a set of independent
us. Thus, the impulsive equations of motion tend to be much simpler than the full dynamical
equations for a given system. For example, there are no elastic force terms and no terms
resulting from centripetal or Coriolis accelerations.
Let us consider a system in which the qs and ? qs may be constrained, but the usa r e
independent. Then the
ˆ
Cs vanish and we obtain

198 Kinematicsanddynamicsofarigidbody
The mass coef?cients m

(q, t) are constant during the application of impulses. They form
a mass matrixm which is positive de?nite and symmetric.
One can solve for thenull us in (3.367) and obtain

where the matrixY= m

Equations (3.367) and (3.368) have the same linear form as the equations of an electrical
circuit. Hence, one can consider input–output relationships. The
ˆ
Qs might be taken as
input impulses whereas thenull us are output responses. The m matrix represents an inertial
resistance to changes in velocity. Proportional increases in magnitudes of them
ij
coef?cients
result in smallernull us for given
ˆ
Qs. On the other hand, theY matrix of (3.368) has an inverse
effect and acts as an admittance matrix for impulsive inputs.
A system characteristic of considerable practical importance is the input or driving-point
mass at a given location. This is the effective mass which an input impulse
ˆ
Q
i
experiences
when all other input impulses are set equal to zero. In the usual case in which u
i
represents
a linear velocity, the corresponding input mass has the units of mass. But if u
i
represents an
angular velocity, then the associated input mass is actually a moment of inertia and
ˆ
Q
i
is
an impulsive moment or couple. In any event, we ?nd that the input or driving-point mass
for an impulsive input at u

is

Note that, in general, this is not equal to m

For the common case in which a linear impulse

in
(3.369) is the velocity change at P in the direction of

Let us consider a system with n degrees of freedom andnu s. Choose u

as shown in Fig. 3.15b. Then the impulse

imposed from outside the system. Furthermore, due to Newton’s law of action and reaction,
we have

(3.376)
Equating the right-hand sides of (3.371) and (3.373), and setting

we obtain

(3.379)
In general, the self-admittances Y

and Y

are positive and Y

is nonzero. Hence,
the input mass at u

is increased, in general, by connecting a second system. The exceptions
are that m

is unchanged if Y

is, Y

Notice that the effect of connecting the second system is to attach its input mass

Then, upon substituting into (3.370) and (3.371), we can solve fornull u

(3.378) and obtain m

as before.
The energy input to an initially motionless system due to a single impulse

(3.384)
This, by the principle of work and kinetic energy, must equal the total kinetic energy of the

we use the concept of input mass. Note that the work done by an impulse on an initially

the work may be positive or negative, depending on the value of u

An interesting consequence of the symmetry of theY matrix is thereciprocityofimpulsive

The second method appears to be simpler, but it involves the inversion of a larger ma-
trix. The second method avoids calculating constraint impulses, but they are thereby not
directly available. Thus, the choice of method depends upon the nature of the desired
results.
Example3.11 As an example of reciprocity, let us consider the angular impulse response
of a rigid body. Let xyz be a principal axis system at the center of mass of the body. Suppose
an angular impulse
ˆ
M is applied about an arbitrary 1-axis which passes through the center
of mass. We wish to ?nd the changenull

in the angular velocity component about a second
arbitrary 2-axis through the center of mass.
Let (c
1x
, c
1y
, c
1z
) be the direction cosines of the positive 1-axis relative to the xyz frame.
Similarly, let (c
2x
, c
2y
, c
2z
) specify the direction of the positive 2-axis. The response com-
ponents in the body-?xed Cartesian frame are

Example 3.12 A system consists of four rods, each of mass m and length l, which are
connected by pin joints, as shown in Fig. 3.17. The system is motionless until ends A and
E are suddenly given equal vertical velocitiesv

velocities of the rods.
First, notice that the system is symmetrical about a vertical line through C. Thus, we can
consider only rods AB and BC which are the left half of the system. From the symmetry,
any motion of point C must be vertical and any interaction impulse at C must be horizontal.

In general, Kelvin’s theorem states that if a system, initially at rest, is suddenly set into
motion by prescribed velocities at some of its points, the actual kinetic energy of the resulting
motion is a minimum compared to other kinematically possible motions.

Equationsofmotion:differentialapproach
In the previous chapters, we have considered relatively familiar methods of obtaining the
differential equations of motion for a mechanical system. In this chapter, we shall introduce
a number of other methods, partly in order to give the student a broader view of dynamics,
and partly to present some practical and ef?cient approaches to obtaining the differential
equations of motion. The results presented here are applicable to holonomic and nonholo-
nomic systems alike, but the emphasis will be on nonholonomic systems because greater
insight is needed in ?nding applicable theoretical approaches for these systems. As we pro-
ceed, we will show the advantages of using quasi-velocities in the analysis of nonholonomic
systems.
4.1 Quasi-coordinates and quasi-velocities
Transformation equations
It is often possible to simplify the analysis of dynamical systems by using quasi-velocities
(us) rather than ? qs as velocity variables. An example is the use of Euler’s equations for
the rotational motion of a rigid body. Here the velocity variables are the body-axis com-
ponents of the angular velocity ? rather than Euler angle rates. The ? components are
quasi-velocities, whereas the Euler angle rates are true ? qs whose time integrals result in
generalized coordinates. As we showed in Chapter 3, the Euler equations are simpler than
the corresponding Lagrange equations written in terms of Euler angles and Euler angle
rates.
The transformation equations relating the us and ? qs can be obtained by starting with the
differential form
d?
j
=
n
null i=1
null ji
(q, t)dq
i
+null jt
(q, t)dt (j = 1,...,n) (4.1)
where the?s are called quasi-coordinates and d?
j

. In general, the right-
hand expressions in (4.1) are not integrable; if they were integrable, the?sw o u l db et r u e
generalized coordinates.
218 Equationsofmotion:differentialapproach
If (4.1) is divided by dt, it has the form
u
j
=

null i=1
null ji
(q, t)? q
i
+null jt
(q, t)( j = 1,...,n) (4.2)
as in (3.245). We assume that these n equations can be solved for the ? qs, resulting in
? q
i
=
n
null j=1
null ij
(q, t)u
j
+null it
(q, t)( i = 1,...,n) (4.3)
Notice that for this unconstrained case, there are the same number of us and ? qs. For
example, the rotational dynamics of a rigid body might have?
x
,?
y
,?
z
as us and the Euler
angles?,?,? as qs. The dynamical equations would be written in terms of us and then the
qs would be generated by integrating (4.3) which are kinematic equations.
Constraints
Now let us impose m nonholonomic constraints of the linear form
n
null i=1
a
ji
(q, t) ? q
i
+ a
jt
(q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (4.4)
as in (1.15). This will be accomplished by changing the notation and setting the lastmu s
in (4.2) equal to zero. Thus, we can write
u
j
=
n
null i=1
null ji
(q, t) ? q
i
+null jt
(q, t)( j = 1,...,n? m) (4.5)
u
j
=
n
null i=1
null ji
(q, t) ? q
i
+null jt
(q, t)=0( j = n? m+ 1,...,n) (4.6)
The ?rst (n? m) usa r eindependent quasi-velocities, while the lastmu s are set equal to
zero to enforce the m nonholonomic constraints.
As before, we assume that the (n× n)? matrix is invertible and we can solve for the ? qs
in the form
? q
i
=
n?m
null j=1
null ij
(q, t)u
j
+null it
(q, t)( i = 1,...,n) (4.7)
The upper limit on the summation is (n? m) because the lastmu s are equal to zero. Note
that the (n× n) matrix? is

(4.8)
Furthermore,

implying that any virtual velocity?w lies in the common intersection of the constraint planes
in velocity space.
4.2 Maggi’s equation
Derivation of Maggi’s equation
Consider a mechanical system whose con?guration is described bynq s and which has m
nonholonomic constraints with the linear form of (4.6). One approach to the problem of
obtaining differential equations of motion is to use Lagrange’s equation in the multiplier
form of (2.49), namely,

(i = 1,...,n) (4.14)
These n second-order equations plus the m ?rst-order constraint equations comprise a
total of (n+ m) equations to solve for thenq s and m?s as functions of time. Frequently,
however, one is not interested in the? solutions, and would prefer a method which eliminates
the?s from the beginning. The use of Maggi’s equation is one such method.
Let us begin with Lagrange’s principle, that is,
n

null d

where the?qs satisfy the virtual constraints of (4.12) and we note that the kinetic energy
T (q, ? q, t) is written for the unconstrained system. The virtual displacements of quasi-
coordinates and true coordinates are related by
??
j

or, upon inversion,

(q, t)??
j
(i = 1,...,n) (4.17)
where, from (4.12), the last m??s are equal to zero.
Now substitute this expression for?q

into (4.15). We obtain

. The set of Maggi equations are (n? m) second-order differential equations
in (q, ? q, ¨ q, t). In addition, there are m equations of constraint, making a total of n equations
to solve for thenq s as functions of time.
Thenull ji
coef?cients are not unique but are chosen in such a way that the ?rst (n? m)
??s are independent and are consistent with the constraints. In the resulting? matrix, each
column represents the amplitude ratios of an independent set of?qs which could be used
in Lagrange’s principle, equation (4.15). Maggi’s equation uses the ?rst (n? m) columns
of? to obtain the (n? m) differential equations of motion.
Example 4.1 Two particles, each of mass m, are connected by a massless rod of length l
(Fig. 4.1). There is a knife-edge constraint at particle 1 which prevents a velocity component
perpendicular to the rod at that point. We wish to use Maggi’s equation to ?nd the differential
equations of motion.

In equations (4.31)–(4.33) we have three equations linear in the ¨ qs. Thus, we can solve for

Example 4.2 Now consider a more complex problem, the rolling motion of a disk on

4.3 The Boltzmann–Hamel equation
We have seen that the Lagrangian approach does not produce correct equations of motion
if the kinetic energy is expressed in terms of quasi-velocities rather than true velocities.
The question arises whether we can add terms to Lagrange’s equation to produce correct
equations in this more general case. The answer is yes, but at the cost of some additional
complications.
Derivation
Let us consider an unconstrained system whose kinetic energy is expressed in the form
T (q, ? q, t), that is, using true velocities ( ? qs). We know that the fundamental form of La-
grange’s equation applies, namely,

We wish to introduce quasi-velocities (us) in place of the ? qs. To accomplish this aim, let
us ?rst assume scleronomic transformation equations of the form

The kinetic energy will be the same in value, whether expressed in terms of ? qso rus, but
will be different in form. So let us write
T
?
(q, u, t)= T (q, ? q, t) (4.64)
where T

is the kinetic energy expressed in terms of quasi-velocities.
First, let us consider

This is the Boltzmann–Hamel equation, published in 1904, for systems described in terms
of quasi-velocities, and assuming independent qs and us. Notice that the added term, com-
pared to Lagrange’s equation, actually involves a quadruple summation, implying increased
complexity. On the other hand, if the us are true velocities, then (4.62) is integrable for all
j and thus all the?
j

parameters vanish. Then (4.75) reduces to Lagrange’s equation with
the?s representing true coordinates.

Thus, there are a total of (2n? m) ?rst-order differential equations to solve for thenq s and

This is a minimal set of equations. One should note that the kinetic energy T (q, u, t)
must be written for the full, unconstrained set ofnu s. All n partial derivatives of the form
?T/?u

must be calculated. After this has been completed, the lastmu s can be set equal

Equation (4.85) is the generalized form of the Boltzmann–Hamel equation. It represents
a minimum set of (n? m) ?rst-order dynamical equations in which the velocity variables
are quasi-velocities. This allows all the us in the ?nal equations to be independent and
consistent with the nonholonomic constraints on the ? qs.
Note that?T/?u

Thus, only the ?rst (n? m) columns of the? matrix enter into the equations of motion,
and, similarly, only the ?rst (n? m) rows and columns of the?
j
matrices are involved.
We have emphasized that the unconstrained kinetic energy is used in the Boltzmann–
Hamel equation. The constraints are applied after the differentiations by setting the lastmu s
equal to zero. It turns out, however, that the ?rst two terms of the Boltzmann–Hamel equation
are unchanged if the constrained kinetic energy is used in obtaining the (n – m) equations.
In other words, for these terms, the order of differentiation and the application of constraints
does not matter, but for the remaining terms, the unconstrained kinetic energy must be used.
4.4 The general dynamical equation
In our study of methods for obtaining the differential equations describing the motions of
nonholonomical systems, we have considered the multiplier form of Lagrange’s equation,
as well as the Maggi and Boltzmann–Hamel equations. All of these classical methods have
their shortcomings.
Ideally, we would like to be able to use quasi-velocities (us) as velocity variables, and
obtain a minimum set of (n? m) ?rst-order dynamical equations for a system withnq s and
m independent nonholonomic constraints. In addition, there are n ?rst-order kinematical
equations, of the form of (4.81). Thus, ideally we would have (2n? m) ?rst-order differ-
ential equations to solve for thenq s and (n? m) us as functions of time. Furthermore, the
procedures should not be overly complicated.
The Lagrangian approach results in a full set of n second-order dynamical equations plus
the m equations of constraint. Furthermore, the kinetic energy cannot be expressed in terms
of quasi-velocities, so us are not present in the equations of motion. This lack of ?exibility
frequently means that the equations of motion are more complicated than necessary.
235 Thegeneraldynamicalequation
The Maggi equations lead to a reduced set of (n? m) second-order dynamical equations
compared to the Lagrangian approach, but quasi-velocities do not appear in these equations.
In addition, m differentiated constraint equations are needed, making a total of n second-
order differential equations to be solved for thenq s as functions of time.
On the other hand, the Boltzmann–Hamel equation produces a minimum set of (n? m)
?rst-order dynamical equations which are written in terms of quasi-velocities. Thus, the
?nal equations have the ideal form. The procedure suffers, however, because the kinetic
energy must be written for the unconstrained system having n degrees of freedom rather
than the constrained system with (n? m) degrees of freedom, and in addition, the basic
equation with its multiple summations is complicated.
In the remaining portion of this chapter, we shall introduce several additional methods
of obtaining the dynamical equations of motion, and will look into their computational
ef?ciency, as illustrated by example problems.
D’Alembert’s principle
Let us begin with the Lagrangian form of d’Alembert’s principle for a system of N particles,
as given by (2.5).

)·?r

Here r
i
is the position vector of the ith particle and F
i
is the applied force acting
on that particle. The virtual displacement ?r
i
is consistent with the m instantaneous
constraints.
Let us assume that the particle velocities are given in terms of (n? m) independent
quasi-velocities in accordance with

?
ij
(q, t)??

(4.126)
where?

Since the??s are independent for j = 1,...,n? m, we obtain

j
+ Q
?
j
=0( j = 1,...,n? m) (4.132)
These (n? m) equations, written in terms of us and ? us, are sometimes known as Kane’s
equations.
For our purposes, we can write
N
null i=1
m
i
? v
i
·?
ij
= Q
j
(j = 1,...,n? m) (4.133)
We shall call this the general dynamical equation for a system of particles. As we have seen,
it derives directly from d’Alembert’s principle. It consists of a minimum set of (n? m) ?rst-
order differential equations in the us, since ? v
i
, in general, will be a function of (q, u, ? u, t)
and is linear in the ? us. In addition, there are n ?rst-order kinematical equations of the form
? q
i
=
n?m
null j=1
null ij
(q, t)u
j
+null it
(q, t)( i = 1,...,n) (4.134)
Thus, there are a total of (2n? m) ?rst-order equations to solve for thenq s and (n? m) us
as functions of time. Notice that the constraint equations do not enter explicitly, but rather
implicitly through the choice of independent us. Furthermore, one does not need to solve
for the constraint forces.
Rigid body equations
Equation (4.133) can be generalized for the case of a system of N rigid bodies (Fig. 4.3).
Suppose that the ith rigid body has a reference point P
i
, ?xed in the body, a mass m
i
, and
an inertia dyadic I
i
about P
i
. The applied forces acting on the ith body are equivalent to
a force F

acting at P

, plus a couple of moment M
i
. In terms of quasi-velocities, we can
write the velocity of the reference point P

the ?exibility in the choice of us can often lead to a simpli?ed analysis.

Equations (4.174)–(4.176) are a minimum set of ?rst-order dynamical equations in the
us. They are identical with the equations obtained by the Boltzmann–Hamel method, but
here they are found by a much simpler procedure. Notice that the constraint equations do
not enter explicitly.
The coef?cients of the us in the dynamical equations are functions of? only; and? can be
generated by integrating u

with respect to time. So, one can obtain? as a function of time
by integrating four ?rst-order equations. However, to obtain the complete con?guration as
a function of time, we need a total of ?ve ?rst-order kinematical equations for the ? qs. First,

Equations (4.205)–(4.207) are the three dynamical equations. In addition, we have three

can be solved for (?

In this example, we have shown how the general dynamical equation can be applied using
quasi-velocities to obtain a minimum set of differential equations describing the motion of
a relatively complex nonholonomic system. This was accomplished without solving for the
constraint forces.

This is a fundamental dynamical equation for a system of particles. It results in (n? m)
?rst-order dynamical equations which are supplemented by the n ?rst-order kinematical
equations for the ? qs. These (2n? m) equations are solved for the (n? m) us andnqsa s
functions of time.
Notice that the dynamical equations are identical to those obtained by the Boltzmann–
Hamel equation but the procedure here is far simpler. Furthermore, the kinetic energy
T (q, u, t) is written for the constrained rather than the unconstrained system.
System of rigid bodies
Let us generalize the results for a system of N particles to a system of N rigid bodies. Let
us choose the reference point for each rigid body at the center of mass. Then in accordance
with Koenig’s theorem, the kinetic energy is

Example4.8 Let us consider once again the motion of a dumbbell (Fig. 4.6) as it moves on

When V olterra’s equation was published, the concept of quasi-velocities was unknown,
so the us were regarded as ? qs. Equation (4.274), however, is more general and can be
used with rheonomic systems that are described using n generalized coordinates with m
nonholonomic constraints. The?= n? m quasi-velocities are independent and the kinetic
energy is written for the constrained system.

System of particles
Let us consider a system of N particles whose con?guration is speci?ed bynq s. The particle

(j = 1,...,n? m) (4.282)
which is the Gibbs–Appell equation for a system of particles. This equation was discovered

255 TheGibbs–Appellequation
minimal set of dynamical equations which are applicable to systems with quasi-velocities
and nonholonomic constraints.
To emphasize an important point, recall that the Gibbs–Appell function is obtained by
substituting ? v
i
forv
i
in the kinetic energy expression, where ? v
i
is the absolute acceleration
of theith particle. One cannot in general, obtain S by writing T (q, ? q, t) and then substituting
¨ qsf o r ? qs. Furthermore, since (4.282) involves differentiations with respect to the ? us, any
terms in S(q, u, ? u, t) which do not contain ? us can be omitted.

Principle of least constraint
The principle of least constraint was discovered by Gauss in 1829, and thereby preceded
the Gibbs–Appell equations, to which it is related, by half a century. The principle of least
constraint is an algebraic minimization principle which leads to the differential equations
of motion. Brie?y, it states that a certain function of the constraint forces is minimized by
the actual motion, as compared with other motions which, at any given time, have the same
con?guration and velocities, but have small variations in the accelerations.
Consider a system of N particles whose con?guration is given by 3N Cartesian coordi-
nates relative to an inertial frame. Suppose there are m equations of constraint, holonomic

or nonholonomic, which can be written in the form

(k= 1,...,3N) (4.321)

which represents the weighted sum of the squares of the constraint force magnitudes. The
principle of least constraint states that C is minimized with respect to variations in the ¨ xs
by the actual motion at each instant of time. It is assumed that the ¨ xs and? ¨ xs satisfy the
constraints.
Thus, noting that F

can be expressed in the linear form of (4.342) after differentiation with respect to time.

Of course, this linear form is integrable.
Let us de?ne an ideal constraint as a workless kinematic constraint which may be either
scleronomic or rheonomic. By workless, we mean that no work is done by the constraint
forces in an arbitrary reversible virtual displacement that is consistent with the instantaneous
constraints. For example, an ideal constraint might be a frictionless surface on which sliding
occurs, or it might involve rolling contact without slipping. Another example is a knife-edge
constraint with no frictional resistance for motion along the knife edge, but with no slipping
allowed perpendicular to it.
262 Equationsofmotion:differentialapproach
LetC

be the generalized ideal constraint force corresponding to the jth constraint. The

in an arbitrary virtual displacement consistent with the instantaneous
constraints is

Equation (4.345) states that the ideal constraint force vectorC
j
and an allowable virtual
displacement?q are orthogonal in n-dimensional con?guration space. A comparison of
(4.345) and (4.348) shows that C
ji
and??
j
/?q
i
are proportional for any given j,s oC
j
is
directed normal to the constraint surface; that is, in the direction of the gradient of?
j
(q, t)
in q-space. Similarly, a comparison of (4.345) and (4.346) indicates that C
j
is directed
normal to the constraint surface in velocity space.
A virtual velocity?w is subject to instantaneous constraint equations of the form
n

=0( j = 1,...,m) (4.349)
or
n

?w

=0( j = 1,...,m) (4.350)
A comparison of (4.346) and (4.349) or (4.347) and (4.350) shows that the permitted
directions of?q and?w are the same, namely, in the tangent plane at the operating point P
in velocity space (Fig. 4.7). The direction of an ideal constraint forceC
j
is perpendicular to
this tangent plane. Note that, for a holonomic constraint, the tangent plane at the operating
point in con?guration space has the same orientation as the corresponding constraint plane
in velocity space.
Now let us de?ne a conservative constraint to be an ideal constraint which meets the
additional condition that
C
j
· ? q= 0 (4.351)
that is, the generalized constraint force C
j
does no work in any possible actual motion of
the system. We found earlier from (4.345) and (4.346) that the components C

are proportional. Hence,
n

?f
j
? ? q
i
? q

= 0 (4.352)
This is just the condition that f
j
(q, ? q, t)isahomogeneous function of the ? qs. In other words,
if a generalized velocity ? q satis?es the constraint, then that velocity multiplied by an arbitrary
scalar constant will also satisfy the constraint. This implies that the corresponding constraint
surface in velocity space can be generated by sweeping a straight line passing through the
origin. It is clear that the common case of a plane passing through the origin is included, but
other possibilities exist, such as, for example, a conical surface with its vertex at the origin.
The homogeneity condition for a conservative constraint requires that a
jt
be zero for
the common case of a linear nonholonomic constraint, that is, it must be catastatic.F o r
a holonomic constraint to be conservative, it must be scleronomic. Thus, coef?cients of
the form a
ji
(q, t) are acceptable in the nonholonomic case, but any holonomic constraint
function must be of the form?
j
(q).
It is possible that a constraint which does not meet the homogeneity condition for a set of
generalized coordinates may be homogeneous in form or may disappear entirely for another
choice of generalized coordinates. Thus, whether a constraint is classed as conservative or
not may depend upon the choice of coordinates.
Conservative system
A conservative system can be de?ned as a dynamical system for which an energy integral
can be found. As an example, let us consider a dynamical system having m nonholonomic
constraints of the general form
f
j
(q, ? q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (4.353)

where the?s are usually nonzero and not easily evaluated. The ?rst term on the right

j
(q, ? q, t) is a homogeneous function of the ? qs, that is, if each
constraint is conservative. The term?L/?t will equal zero if neither T nor V is an explicit
function of time.
In summary, a system having holonomic or nonholonomic constraints will beconservative
if it meets the following conditions:
1. The standard form of Lagrange’s equation, as given by (4.354), applies.
2. All constraints are conservative.
3. The Lagrangian function L = T ? V is not an explicit function of time.
These are suf?cient conditions for a conservative system. Note that the conserved integral

Consider a system of N rigid bodies. The forces acting on the ith body are equivalent to
a force F
i
acting at a reference point P
i
plus a couple M
i
. Let v
i
be the velocity of point
P
i
,? x e di nt h eith body, and let ?
i
be the angular velocity of the body. Assume linear
nonholonomic constraints.
From the principle of work and kinetic energy, and summing over the N bodies,
?

Now let us assume that a portion of F

and M

arise from a potential energy function
V (q, t), but the remaining primed quantitiesF

do not. Thus, we have

It appears that, in the general nonholonomic case, the left-hand side of (4.394) is easier to
evaluate that is its right-hand side. Thus, (4.380) is more direct than (4.393) in the general
case.
From (4.380), we see that suf?cient conditions for a conservative system, implying a
constant value of E,are:
1. Q

= 0 for all j, that is, all the generalized forces Q

are derivable from a potential
energy function of the form V (q).

Example4.13 A rheonomic nonholonomic system consists of two particles, each of mass

These two equations of motion constitute a minimum set for this system which has two
degrees of freedom.
Equation (4.420) can be interpreted as stating that the rate of change of linear momentum
in the direction of the knife edge is equal to zero. The second equation of motion, (4.423),
states that, if particle 1 is chosen as a noninertial reference point, the rate of change of
angular momentum is equal to the inertial moment due to the acceleration of particle 1.
Thus, it is convenient to think in terms of an accelerating but nonrotating reference frame
in this instance.

are all equal to zero, so
?
E = 0.
Thus, the energy function E, which in this case is the total kinetic energy, is constant during
the motion.
This is an example of a system for which the kinetic energy is an explicit function of
time and yet it is conservative.

Second method If the Lagrangian method is used, we have three differential equations
of motion involving Lagrange multipliers. Also, there is the nonholonomic constraint
equation
?? x sin(?+null t)+ ? y cos(?+null t)= 0 (4.425)
which states that the velocity of particle 1 normal to the knife edge is zero.
The kinetic energy of the unconstrained system is

?(?? x sin?+ ? y cos?)] (4.426)
We note that T is not an explicit function of time, and we can take the potential energy
function V equal to zero; hence?L/?t = 0. Furthermore, the nonholonomic constraint
is homogeneous and linear in the ? qs, and is therefore conservative. Thus, the suf?cient
conditions for a conservative system are satis?ed, implying, in this case, that the total
kinetic energy is a constant of the motion.
Third method Let us use the Boltzmann–Hamel approach. The equations for a complete

(4.423) are obtained. The Boltzmann–Hamel energy rate expression in (4.393) reduces for
this example to

Comparing the three methods which were presented for analyzing this rheonomic non-
holonomic system, the ?rst method using the fundamental dynamical equation for a system
of particles would seem to be preferable. It provides a minimum set of equations of motion
without Lagrange multipliers. Furthermore, the energy rate is found to be zero by inspection.
4.8 Summary of differential methods
In the study of differential methods in the dynamics of systems of particles or rigid bod-
ies, it is well to begin with Newton’s law of motion. Angular momentum methods can
also be employed, resulting in Euler’s equations for the rotational motion of rigid bod-
ies. These elementary approaches frequently require the introduction of constraint forces
and moments as additional variables in the dynamical equations, thereby complicating the
analysis.
Lagrange’s equations, when applied to holonomic systems with independent qs, result
in a minimum set of equations of motion without the necessity of solving for constraint
forces. In other words, although one set of qs may be subject to holonomic constraints,
another set of qs can be found which are independent and are consistent with the previous
constraints. No generalized constraint forces enter into the Lagrange equations of motion
for this system.
On the other hand, if there are nonholonomic constraints, then more qs are required than
the number of degrees of freedom. The use of the Lagrangian procedure involves Lagrange
multipliers which are associated with generalized constraint forces. If there arenq s and m
constraint equations, one obtains n second-order dynamical equations in addition to the m
constraint equations.
The use of Maggi’s equation eliminates the Lagrange multipliers and results in (n? m)
second-order equations of motion plus the m constraint equations. The Lagrange and Maggi
methods have the disadvantages, however, that the kinetic energy cannot be written in terms
of quasi-velocities, and must be written for the unconstrained system.
In the ef?cient representation of dynamical systems, it is desirable to obtain a minimal
s e to f( n? m) ?rst-order differential equations of motion. This is possible in the general
nonholonomic case if one uses independent quasi-velocities as velocity variables. The
remaining four differential methods discussed in this chapter all result in a minimal set of
dynamical equations. The use of the Boltzmann–Hamel equation is the most complicated of
these methods and requires that the kinetic energy be written for the unconstrained system
having n degrees of freedom. The other three methods allow one to assume a constrained
system with (n? m) degrees of freedom from the beginning.
275 Summaryofdifferentialmethods
Energy rate expressions can be obtained in several forms, depending upon the type of
dynamical equations used in their derivation. Each of these expressions can be used to obtain
a set of suf?cient conditions for a conservative system, that is, a system having a constant
energy function E. In the usual case, E = T

+ V rather than the total energy T + V .
If the equations of motion for a given system are being integrated numerically, the energy
rate
?
E can be used as a check on the calculations. This is accomplished by integrating
?
E
separately with respect to time, and comparing the change in the energy E with that obtained
from the integrated solutions to the equations of motion.
A note on quasi-velocities
We have de?ned quasi-velocities (us) in accordance with the equations
u
j
=
n
null i=1
null ji
(q, t) ? q
i
+null jt
(q, t)( j = 1,...,n) (4.435)
where the right-hand sides are not integrable, in general. Moreover, we assumed that these
equations can be solved for the ? qs, resulting in
? q
i
=
n
null j=1
null ij
(q, t)u
j
+null it
(q, t)( i = 1,...,n) (4.436)
Thus, we have assumed that the us and ? qs are related linearly. If there are m linear non-
holonomic constraints, these are represented by setting the lastmu s equal to zero. The
remaining (n? m) us are independent.
Furthermore, we have expressed velocities and angular velocities in accordance with the
linear relations

and we note that the?s and?s can be used in writing the differential equations of motion.
It is possible, however, to de?ne the us in a way such that, in general, the ? qs are nonlinear
functions of theus. For a system withnqs andm independent nonholonomic constraints, one
can de?ne the (n? m) independent usa sa set of parameters which specify the operating
point in velocity space, that is, ? q-space. This operating point must lie on each of the m
constraint surfaces in velocity space, and therefore on their common intersection.
We need to ?nd expressions for the ?s and ?s in writing the equations of motion,
but the linear equations (4.437) and (4.438) are no longer valid for the more general us.
Nevertheless, we can use

Ag i v e ns e to fus may not have uniform dimensions, and so the question now arises
concerning how the corresponding Qs are to be found. One can use virtual work or, in this
case, virtual power to evaluate the Qs. For example, if a system of N particles has a force

Equationsofmotion:integralapproach
Integral principles and, in particular, Hamilton’s principle, have long occupied a prominent
position in analytical mechanics. Hamilton’s principle, ?rst announced in 1834, presents
a variational principle as the basis for the dynamical description of a holonomic system.
This approach tends to view the motion as a whole and involves a search for the path in
con?guration space which yields a stationary value for a certain integral. As a result, one
obtains the differential equations of motion.
The requirement of stationarity does not apply to nonholonomic systems. Nevertheless,
one can use integral methods to obtain the equations of motion for nonholonomic systems.
Here we use the integral of the variation rather than the variation of the integral. In this
chapter, we shall discuss the derivation and application of these methods, particularly with
respect to nonholonomic systems.
5.1 Hamilton’s principle
Holonomic system
Consider a dynamical system whose motion satis?es Lagrange’s principle, namely,
n
null i=1
null d
dt
null ?T
? ? q
i
null ?
?T
?q
i
? Q
i

= 0 (5.1)
There are n generalized coordinates and the?qs satisfy the instantaneous constraints. The
kinetic energy T (q, ? q, t) is written for the unconstrained system, and is assumed to have
at least two continuous derivatives in each of its arguments. Q
i
is the generalized applied
force associated with q
i
.
Now integrate (5.1) with respect to time over the ?xed interval t
1
to t
2
. Using integration
by parts, we ?nd that

=0( j = 1,...,m) (5.4)
and are assumed to equal zero at the ?xed end points t
1
and t
2
. Thus, the right-hand side of
(5.3) vanishes.
The actual and varied paths in extended con?guration space are shown in Fig. 5.1. The
?qsarecontemporaneous variations, that is, they take place with time held ?xed. Note that,
for a given actual path, the varied path is speci?ed by the?qs which satisfy (5.4).
Let us assume that the qs and ? qs are continuous functions of time along the actual and
varied paths. Then we can write
d
dt
(?q
i
)=? ? q
i
(i = 1,...,n) (5.5)
The transposition of d and? operators will be discussed later in the chapter.
Referring again to (5.3), note that

(5.7)
Thus, we obtain
null t 2
t 1
(?T +?W )dt= 0 (5.8)
This important result applies to the same wide variety of dynamical systems as does
Lagrange’s principle as given by (5.1). We shall return to this equation when we consider
nonholonomic systems.
Now let us assume that all the applied forces are associated with a potential energy
function V (q, t). Then?W=??V and we can write (5.8) in the form
null t 2
t 1
?Ldt= 0 (5.9)
where the Lagrangian function L(q, ? q, t)= T ? V . Assuming a holonomic system,t h e
operations of integration and variation can be interchanged. Thus, we obtain
?
null t 2
t 1
Ldt= 0 (5.10)
which is the usual form of Hamilton’s principle.
The variation of the integral in (5.10) implies that the actual and varied paths satisfy the
m constraint equations of the form
n
null i=1
q
ji
(q, t) ? q
i
+ a
jt
(q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (5.11)
where these expressions are integrable in this holonomic case. On the other hand, the integral
of the variation, as in (5.9), implies that the?qs in the expression for?L must satisfy the
instantaneous constraints of (5.4). For holonomic systems, the varied paths satisfy both the
actual and instantaneous constraint equations. The solutions of (5.10) have the property of
stationarity; whereas the solutions of (5.9) may or may not have this property, depending
on the nature of the constraints.
Now let us restate Hamilton’s principle, as it applies to holonomic systems, as follows:
The actual path in con?guration space followed by a holonomic dynamical system between
the ?xed times t
1
and t
2
is such that the integral
I =
null t 2
t 1
Ldt (5.12)
is stationary with respect to path variations which vanish at the end-points.
To reiterate, the primary assumptions in the derivation of Hamilton’s principle are that:
(1) the variations?q
i
satisfy the instantaneous constraint equations; (2) the end-points are
?xed in con?guration space and time; and (3) all the applied forces are derivable from a
potential energy function V (q, t). Note that the system need not be conservative.
292 Equationsofmotion:integralapproach
An alternate approach to obtaining the equations of motion for a holonomic system is to
begin with Hamilton’s principle as a stationarity principle. With this as a starting point, and
using the same assumptions as before, we can derive Lagrange’s principle. To see how this
develops, let us begin with
?

yielding

?L
?q

=0( i = 1,...,n) (5.15)
which is Lagrange’s equation. This is also the Euler–Lagrange equation of the calculus of
variations.
On the other hand, if the?qs are constrained by (5.4), then the integrand must equal zero
at each instant of time since the limits t
1
and t
2
are arbitrary. Thus, we obtain Lagrange’s
principle, namely,

Nonholonomic system
Although stationarity, as expressed in Hamilton’s principle, is central to the dynamical
theory of holonomic systems, it does not apply to nonholonomic systems. To see how this
comes about, let us consider a nonholonomic system and require that each varied path must
satisfy the actual constraint equations of the general form
f
j
(q, ? q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (5.17)
These constraints are enforced by invoking the multiplier rule. The multiplier rule states
that the constrained stationary values of the integral of (5.12) are found by considering the
free variations of

Note that (5.21) merely restates the constraint equations.
Now let us apply (5.20) to a nonholonomic system in which the constraint functions are
linear in the ? qs. Thus, the constraint equations have the familiar form

These are the Euler–Lagrange equations for ?nding the solution path leading to a sta-
tionary value of the integral I of (5.12), where both the actual and varied paths satisfy the
constraints given by (5.22). Comparing (5.23) with the known form of Lagrange’s equation

we see that, in general, the equations are different. We conclude that the requirement of
stationarity leads to incorrect dynamical equations for the general case of nonholonomic
constraints. Conversely, the solution path of a nonholonomic system will not, in general,
result in a stationary value of the integral in (5.12).

which are the exactness conditions, then the system is holonomic and (5.23) reduces to the
correct equation (5.24).
The correct equations of motion of a nonholonomic system can be obtained from
null t 2

?Ldt= 0 (5.26)
which may be considered to be the nonholonomic form of Hamilton’s principle.I ti sn o ta
stationarity principle, however, and thereby differs fundamentally from its usual holonomic
form given in (5.10). Equation (5.26) assumes that: (1) the actual and varied paths are
continuous functions of time and their difference?q satis?es the instantaneous constraint
equations; (2) the?qs equal zero at the ?xed end-points t
1
and t
2
; and (3) all the applied
forces arise from a potential energy function V (q, t).
More generally, when the applied forces do not arise from a potential energy function,
one can use
null t 2

(?T +?W )dt= 0 (5.27)
where the virtual work is
?W =

and the?qs satisfy (5.4). As we found in the derivation of (5.8), this result is essentially an
integrated form of Lagrange’s principle, (5.1).

We can take V = 0, so Hamilton’s principle has the nonholonomic form

The nonholonomic constraint equation is

296 Equationsofmotion:integralapproach
which states that the velocity of point P perpendicular to the knife edge is zero. The
corresponding instantaneous constraint equation is
sin?? x? cos?? y= 0 (5.37)
We can choose two independent sets of (?x,?y,??) which satisfy (5.37). Let us choose
virtual displacements proportional to (cos?,sin?,0) and (0, 0, 1). Then, from (5.35) we
obtain the following two differential equations of motion:

Alternatively, we could have noted that

and then considered?x and?? to be independent.
We need a third differential equation which is obtained by differentiating (5.36) with
respect to time.
¨ x sin?? ¨ y cos?+ ? x

Equations (5.38), (5.39), and (5.41) are linear in the ¨ qs and can be solved for ¨ x, ¨ y, and
¨
?,
which are integrated to obtain the motion as a function of time.
The approach used in this example has yielded three second-order equations, namely,
two dynamical equations and one kinematical equation. Notice that ? qs have been used as
velocity variables in the kinetic energy function; quasi-velocities should be avoided because
equations similar to (5.32) will not apply.
5.2 Transpositional relations
Now let us examine the kinematical effects due to the nonintegrability of the quasi-velocity
expressions and constraint equations often associated with nonholonomic systems. As be-
fore, we shall ultimately be concerned with time integrals of variational expressions, al-
though the transpositional relations under consideration here are differential in nature.
Hence, we will actually study the kinematics of differential paths in con?guration space.

(q, t)dt (j = 1,...,n) (5.42)
In general, the differential form is not integrable, so?
j
is a quasi-coordinate. The operator
d,a si ndq

, represents an in?nitesimal change in the variable q
i
which occurs during the

(q, t)( j = 1,...,n) (5.43)
which, again, is not integrable, in general. Here the quasi-velocity u

The variational equation corresponding to (5.42) is

The operator? in?q

which is assumed to occur
with time held ?xed.
Now let us consider the operations? and d taken in sequence. Taking the total differential

The basic transpositional equations such as (5.47), (5.54), and (5.59) are written for an
unconstrained system. The application of constraints, however, will be shown to be quite
simple.
Nonholonomic constraints
Consider a system with n generalized coordinates and m nonholonomic constraints which
are linear in the ? qs. We can represent these constraints by setting to zero the last m equations
of (5.42) or (5.43). Thus, we have

(q, t)=0( j = n? m+ 1,...,n) (5.63)
The m constraints are given by (5.63). Note that the ?rst (n? m) us given by (5.62) are
independent. Thus, as velocity variables, we can use the (n? m)us rather thann constrained
? qs.
In a similar fashion, using (5.44), we can write the variational equations for the constrained
system.

With the application of the constraints, we see that

The theoremof Frobenius
If the expressions for F
j
given in (5.48) are all equal to zero for an unconstrained system,
then the exactness conditions apply for the n differential forms of (5.42). These exactness
conditions are suf?cient for the integrability of the differential forms, implying that the?s
are true generalized coordinates rather than quasi-coordinates.
A question arises concerning the necessary and suf?cient conditions for the integrabil-
ity of the differential forms if there are constraints. This is answered by the Theorem of
Frobenius: A system of differential equations such as (5.42) is completely integrable to
yield?
j
=?
j
(q, t) for j = 1,...,n if and only if F
j
= 0 for all dq
i
and?q
i
satisfying the
constraints. Recall that F
j
is given by (5.48).
As an example, consider a constraint which is represented by the differential form
d? = a(x, y, z)dx+ b(x, y, z)dy+ c(x, y, z)dz= 0 (5.69)
Also,
??= a(x, y, z)?x+ b(x, y, z)?y+ c(x, y, z)?z= 0 (5.70)
This constraint is integrable, that is, holonomic if F
j
= 0 or, in detail, if

This is the necessary and suf?cient condition for the integrability of (5.69).
Geometrical considerations
First, let us consider an unconstrained system described in terms of n quasi-velocities which
are given by (5.43). We wish to compare points on an actual path in n-dimensional q-space
with the corresponding points on a varied path. This can be visualized by considering a
small quadrilateral ABCD, as shown in Fig. 5.3a. The in?nitesimal vector dq occurs on
the actual path during a small time interval dt. The variation?q is an in?nitesimal vector
drawn from a point on the actual path to a corresponding point (at the same time) on the
varied path. Thus, the operator d refers to differences that occur along a solution path with
the passage of time; whereas,? refers to differences in going from the actual path to a varied
path with time held constant.
For this unconstrained case, the small quadrilateral ABCD is closed. We see that the
vector displacements ABC and ADC are equal. Thus
dq+?q+ d?q=?q+ dq+?dq (5.75)
and
d?q=?dq (5.76)
In terms of components,
d?q
i
??dq
i
=0( i = 1,...,n) (5.77)
This result applies to a holonomic system for which all F
j
= 0. On the other hand, even for
an unconstrained or holonomic system, if (5.77) applies, then (5.49) shows that for each
F
j
null 0 due to the presence of quasi-velocities, there is a corresponding transpositional term

302 Equationsofmotion:integralapproach
Now let us consider the more general case in which there are m nonholonomic constraints
that are applied to the system by setting the last m differential forms equal to zero. Thus,
we assume that
d?
j
= 0,? ?
j
=0( j = n? m+ 1,...,n) (5.79)
as in (5.61) and (5.65). Since the virtual constraint applies at B and the actual constraint
applies at D in Fig. 5.3b, we see that
d??
j
= 0,? d?
j
=0( j = n? m+ 1,...,n) (5.80)
and therefore
d??
j
??d?
j
=0( j = n? m+ 1,...,n) (5.81)
Assuming that F
j
null 0f o rj = n? m+ 1,...,n, we see from (5.49) that at least m of
the d?q
i
??dq
i
are nonzero, implying that
d?q??dqnull 0 (5.82)
Thus, the quadrilateral in Fig. 5.3b does not close, and the vector in n-space directed from
C
null to C is equal to d?q??dq. This lack of closure indicates that, even at the differential
level, there is path dependence due to the nonintegrability of the nonholonomic constraints.
For example, if there is one nonholonomic constraint, it is kinematically possible to obtain
closure for all but one of the component qs. However, the remaining d?q
i
??dq
i
must
be nonzero, resulting in nonclosure in n-space. Similarly, if there are m nonholonomic
constraints, then at least m of the d?q
i
??dq
i
must be nonzero.
For a nominal point A on the actual path, it is important to understand how thenull ji

(q, t) coef?cients are evaluated when applying the constraints at points B and D.
At A we have the constraint equations

We have presented a derivation which emphasizes the assumptions concerning the values
of the coef?cients at points B and D which are slightly displaced from the nominal reference
point A. Note, however, that ultimately all calculations involve values at A; and this applies
as well to calculations of F
j
.
As a result of the lack of closure of the differential quadrilaterals if there are nonholonomic
constraints, it is not possible to ?nd a continuous varied path which simultaneously satis?es
the actual constraints and the virtual or instantaneous constraints. One must choose one or
the other. If one chooses the stationarity principle in which the varied paths are required
to satisfy the actual constraints but not the virtual constraints, then incorrect equations of
304 Equationsofmotion:integralapproach
motion result, as we found earlier. On the other hand, if the varied paths satisfy the virtual
constraints but not the actual constraints, the variational process produces correct equations
of motion, as we found in the discussion of Hamilton’s principle.

equations of motion as (5.94) but is somewhat simpler to apply.
Example 5.2 A dumbbell consists of two particles, each of mass m, connected by a
massless rod of length l. There is a knife-edge constraint at particle 1 (Fig. 5.4). We wish
to ?nd the equations of motion as the system moves in the horizontal xy-plane.

From (5.123)–(5.128), we obtain the central equation of Heun and Hamel:

(?P)=?T +?W +?D (5.129)
Explicit form
The central equation has the same general validity as d’Alembert’s principle from which it
was derived. The principal assumption is that the?rs satisfy the virtual constraints. There
is a need, however, to put the central equation in a more convenient, usable form.
First, let us transform to generalized coordinates. In terms of velocity coef?cients, we

Furthermore, let us apply the m virtual constraints by letting ??

Notice that this result is similar to (5.101), the transpositional form of the Boltzmann–
Hamel equation.
The (n? m) differential equations of motion are obtained by writing the last term of
(5.153) as a function of the??s, and then setting the coef?cient of each??
r
in (5.153)
equal to zero. As mentioned earlier, the kinetic energy T
?
(q, u, t) may be written for the
311 Thecentralequation
constrained system, that is, the order of differentiation and the application of constraints
makes no difference in this case. But the kinetic energy T (q, ? q, t) must be written for the
unconstrained system.
The Boltzmann–Hamel equation can be derived from the general result given in (5.151).

This is a detailed form of the Boltzmann–Hamel equation, as in (4.82). Here the derivation
involves an integral method using the central equation. We note from (5.155) that, in spite
of transpositional terms in the integral expressed in (5.150), the varied path is actually
determined by?qsor??s which satisfy the virtual constraints.
Example 5.3 A thin uniform disk of mass m and radius r rolls without slipping on the
horizontal xy-plane (Fig. 5.5). Let us ?nd the differential equations of motion, using the

assumption, the contact point moves with a speed r

(q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (5.196)
This form has the characteristic that all the qs are treated equally. Now let us change
the viewpoint and arbitrarily designate m of the qsa sdependent; whereas, the remaining
316 Equationsofmotion:integralapproach
(n? m) qs are termed independent. Equation (5.196) can be solved for the dependent ? q

in terms of the independent ? q

Suslov’s principle
Let us begin with the general nonholonomic form of Hamilton’s principle, namely,
null t 2
t 1
(?T +?W )dt= 0 (5.199)
where each varied path satis?es the virtual constraints, and the?qs are equal to zero at the
end-points in extended q-space (Fig. 5.1).
Now introduce the constrained kinetic energy T
0
(q, ? q
I
, t) which is obtained from the
unconstrained kinetic energy T (q, ? q, t) by substituting for the ? q
D
s using the constraint equa-
tions (5.197). For any realizable motion, the energies T
0
and T are equal. Their variations
?T

and?T are not equal, however. To see how this comes about, consider
?T =

null i=1
?T
?q

?q

For a given varied path, we can take

(?q

=0( i = 1,...,n) (5.201)
and therefore we obtain that, in (5.199),

For the constrained system, however, we know that at least m of the transpositional expres-
sions of (5.201) must be nonzero. Let us assume that
d

where we have used (5.203). Now integrate?T

with respect to time, using integration by
parts on the last term and noting that?q

vanishes at t

and t

. Upon multiplying by?1 and
recalling (5.210), the integral of (5.208) can be written in the form

The transpositional term can be written as a homogeneous linear expression in the?q

form of Suslov’s principle:

The equations of motion are obtained by expressing the last term in terms of?q
I
s and then
equating to zero the coef?cient of each?q
I
. This results in (n? m) second-order differential
equations. There are also m kinematical constraint equations, giving a total of n equations
to solve for thenq s.
Comparing this result with the explicit central equation, (5.153), we see that the Suslov
equation has the advantage that the last summation is over the m dependent ? qs only rather
than over the complete set of n. On the other hand, Suslov’s equation has the possible
disadvantage that it does not allow quasi-velocities to be used.
Example 5.4 As an example of the application of Suslov’s equation (5.216), consider
the motion of a dumbbell with a knife-edge constraint sliding on the horizontal xy-plane
(Fig. 5.6). As generalized coordinates, let us choose (?,x, y), where (?,x) are considered
independent and y is dependent.
The nonholonomic constraint equation is
? q
D
= ? y= ? x tan? (5.217)
and the corresponding virtual constraint is
?q

Hamilton’s principle, namely,
null t 2

(?T +?W )dt= 0 (5.250)

Here the kinetic energy T (q, ? q, t) is unconstrained and

d

(?q

since we assume that
d

(?q

)?? ? q
i
= 0 (5.252)
Furthermore, the varied path determined by the?qs satis?es the virtual constraints of (5.4)
but does not satisfy, in general, the actual constraints of (5.11).
Hamilton’s principle leads to equations of motion of the form given by Lagrange’s prin-
ciple or Maggi’s equation.
The other integral methods can be derived directly from Hamilton’s principle. For exam-
ple, if the kinetic energy in terms of quasi-velocities is T
?
(q, u, t) and we use the substitution
?T =?T
?
+
n
null i=1
?T
? ? q

null d
dt
(?q
i
)?? ? q
i
null (5.253)
in (5.250), the result after integration by parts reduces to the explicit form of the central
equation, (5.153).
On the other hand, if we designate the qs as either independent or dependent, and write
the constrained kinetic energy T
0
(q, ? q
I
, t), then the substitution
?T =?T
0
+
n
null D=n?m+1
?T
? ? q
D
null d
dt
(?q

D
null (5.254)
in (5.250) results in the explicit form of Suslov’s principle, (5.216). Here we assume that
d
dt
(?q
I
)?? ? q
I
=0( I = 1,...,n? m) (5.255)
All these methods utilize varied paths, determined by the?qs, which satisfy the virtual
constraints but not the actual constraints. Furthermore, for a given system and varied path,
the integrals used in the various methods will all be equal to?P at any given time t,
where t
1
< t< t
2
. Thus, differing notation and variables are being used to express the same
basic integral of Hamilton’s principle. The differing approaches, however, can result in one
method being easier than another, depending upon the particular system being analyzed.

Introductiontonumericalmethods
Digital computers are used extensively in the analysis of dynamical systems. The equations
describing the motion of a system are partly dynamic and partly kinematic in nature. In either
case, they take the form of ordinary differential equations which are nonlinear, in general.
These differential equations are usually written with time as the independent variable, and
time is assumed to vary in a continuous manner from some initial value, frequently zero, to
a ?nal value.
In any representation using digital computers, the time can assume only a ?nite number of
discrete values. The differential equations of the system are replaced by difference equations.
The solutions of these difference equations are not the same, in general, as the solutions
of the corresponding differential equations at the given discrete times, thereby introducing
computational errors. More importantly, if parameters such as step size are not properly
chosen, a given numerical procedure may produce an apparent unstable response for a
system that is actually stable.
In this chapter, we shall begin with a brief discussion of the interpolation and extrapolation
of digital data. Then we will proceed with a discussion of various algorithms for the numer-
ical integration of ordinary differential equations. The errors arising from these numerical
procedures will be discussed, and questions of numerical stability will be considered.
Another important consideration in the numerical analysis of dynamical systems lies in
the proper representation of geometrical constraints. Even if the physical system is stable,
there may be numerical instabilities resulting from the method of applying constraints. We
shall discuss methods of representing constraints and will analyze their stability.
Finally, a topic of great interest is that of error detection and correction. One approach
is to use integrals of the motion, that is, functions whose values remain constant during the
motion. Examples are the energy or angular momentum functions associated with certain
systems. Any deviations from the expected values of these functions serve as indicators of
errors and are the starting point for possible corrections. These possibilities will be discussed.
6.1 Interpolation
Polynomial approximations
Consider a function of time f (t) whose values are given at the (n+ 1) distinct points
t
0
, t
1
,...,t
n
. It is always possible to ?nd an interpolating polynomial of degree n which
330 Introductiontonumericalmethods
passes exactly through these (n+ 1) points. Let us choose
P
n
(t)= a
0
+ a
1
t+···+a
n
t
n
(6.1)
as the approximating polynomial to y= f (t) and let
y
i
= f (t
i
) (6.2)
We can determine the (n+ 1) coef?cients a
o
,a
1
,...,a
n
from the (n+ 1) equations
y
i
=
n
null k=0
a
k
t
k
i
(i = 0, 1,...,n) (6.3)
which are linear in the as. For distinct times t
0
, t
1
,...,t
n
, a solution for the asi sa l w a y s
possible because the determinant of their coef?cients is always nonzero. Thus, we can obtain
the interpolating polynomial P
n
(t).
Lagrange’s interpolation formula
An alternative form of the same interpolating polynomial can be obtained by ?rst using the
notation
null i
(t)= (t? t
0
)(t? t
1
)···(t? t
i?1
)(t? t
i+1
)···(t? t
n
) (6.4)
We note that the factor (t? t
i
) is omitted. Now de?ne a sampling polynomial
?
i
(t)=
null i
(t)
null i
(t
i
)
(i = 0, 1,...,n) (6.5)
which is a polynomial of degree n in t. It has the property that it is equal to zero at all
the sampling times t
0
, t
1
,...except at t
i
where its value is one. It is apparent, then, that a
polynomial of degree n which passes through the (n+ 1) discrete points is
P
n
(t)=
n
null i=0
y
i
?
i
(t)=
n
null i=0
y
i
null i
(t)
null i
(t
i
)
(6.6)
This is the Lagrange interpolation formula.
An estimate of the error in P
n
(t) can be expressed as a polynomial of degree (n+ 1) in t.
Moreover, we know that the error is zero at the (n+ 1) points t
0
, t
1
,...,t
n
. So let us assume
that
y(t)? P
n
(t)+ C(t? t
0
)(t? t
1
)···(t? t
n
) (6.7)
where C is a constant to be determined. Now let us differentiate this equation (n+ 1) times
with respect to t. The terms arising from P
n
(t) will disappear completely, and we need to
consider only the term Ct
n+1
since the others will vanish upon differentiation. With the aid
of the mean value theorem, we can write
y
(n+1)
(?)= (n+ 1)!C (t
0
<?<t
n
) (6.8)
331 Interpolation
where y
(n+1)
is the (n+ 1)th time derivative of y(t). Thus, from (6.7) and (6.8), we obtain
y(t)= P
n
(t)+
(t? t
0
)(t? t
1
)···(t? t
n
)
(n+ 1)!
y
(n+1)
(?) (6.9)
The second term on the right represents the error R
n
(t), that is,
R
n
(t)=
(t? t
0
)(t? t
1
)···(t? t
n
)
(n+ 1)!
y
(n+1)
(?) (6.10)
It should be noted that the error in the polynomial approximation does not necessarily
decrease with increasing n. This is particularly true when the sample times t
0
,...,t
n
are
equally spaced and the evaluation occurs at a time t near the limits of the overall interval
[t
0
, t
n
]. The problem arises for functions such as tant,l nt, and 1/(1+ t)
2
whose Taylor
series each have a ?nite radius of convergence. Although there is an exact match of P
n
(t)
and y(t)a tt h e( n+ 1) discrete points, there is no restriction on the derivatives at these
points. Thus, for polynomials of relatively high degree, it is possible for large errors to
occur between sample times. This is known as the Runge phenomenon. On the other hand,
functions such as sint and e
t
, whose Taylor series representations have no convergence
problems, will not be subject to these large errors.
Divided difference
Consider the polynomial P
n
(t) passing through the (n+ 1) points (y
i
, t
i
) where i =
0, 1,...,n. De?ne the divided difference
[t
a
, t
b
]= [t
b
, t
a
]=
y
b
? y
a
t
b
? t
a
(6.11)
Similarly, a second-order divided difference is
[t
a
, t
b
, t
c
]=
[t
b
, t
c
]? [t
a
, t
b
]
t
c
? t
a
(6.12)
Again, the order of the arguments makes no difference. More generally, for the (n+ 1)
timest
0
,...,t
n
,thenth-order divided difference, written in terms of (n? 1)th-order divided
differences, is
[t
0
, t
1
,...,t
n
]=
[t
1
, t
2
,...,t
n
]? [t
0
, t
1
,...,t
n?1
]
t
n
? t
0
(6.13)
Divided differences can be used in expressing the interpolating polynomial P
n
(t). Con-
sider Newton’s interpolation formula:
P
n
(t)= y
0
+ (t? t
0
){[t
0
, t
1
]+ (t? t
1
)[ [t

2
]+ (t? t
2
)([t
0
, t
1
, t
2
, t
3
]+··· )]} (6.14)
where the expression is continued until [t
0
, t
1
,...,t
n
] appears.
The coef?cients to be used in Newton’s interpolation formula can be computed with
the aid of a divided difference table. For example, consider the case of four sample times
332 Introductiontonumericalmethods
t
0
, t
1
, t
2
, and t
3
. The corresponding divided difference table is

[t

As a numerical example, consider the function y= log

The cubic curve passing through the four given points is found by using Newton’s interpo-
lation formula with the numerical coef?cients obtained from the ?rst entry of each column.
Thus, we obtain
P
3
(t)= 0+ (t? 1){0.30103+ (t? 2)[?0.06247+ (t? 3)(0.01230)]}
For the case t = 2.5, for example, the interpolation result is
P
3
(2.5)= 1.5{0.30103+ 0.5[?0.06247? 0.5(0.01230)]}=0.40008
The actual value is log
10
2.5= 0.39794.
An alternate form of Newton’s interpolation formula is
P

(t)= y

+···+(t? t

)···(t? t
n?1
)[t

This leads to an error or remainder term of the form
R
n
(t)= (t? t

)···(t? t
n
)[t
0
, t
1
,...,t
n
, t] (6.16)
which is obtained by considering t to be an additional data point and writing the next
term, recalling that there would be zero error at time t if the additional term R
n
(t)i s
included. Comparing this result with (6.10), and assuming that t is an interior point, we ?nd
that

Forward and backward differences
Let us consider differences associated with a uniform time intervalnull t = h. The forward

The forward difference operator has the property of linearity, that is,

where a and b are constants. Furthermore, for a product of two functions of time,

6.2 Numerical integration
In the study of dynamical systems we consider, in general, ordinary differential equa-
tions with time as the independent variable. If one uses Lagrangian methods, the resulting
336 Introductiontonumericalmethods
second-order equations of motion are nonlinear, in general, but are always linear in the ¨ qs.
Usually each second-order differential equation is converted to two ?rst-order equations
before numerical integration takes place, resulting in the solution for the dependent vari-
ables as functions of time. Numerical integration is accomplished by ?rst converting the
differential equations to difference equations. These equations are then solved at discrete
instants of time. The solutions of the difference equations ideally should be the same as
the solutions of the differential equations evaluated at the discrete times. Now let us con-
sider some of the numerical procedures or algorithms used in the integration of ordinary
differential equations. The errors associated with these methods will be evaluated.
Euler’s method
Let us begin with a single ?rst-order differential equation
? y= f (y, t) (6.51)
Choose a step sizenull t = h and assume that the initial condition y(t
0
)= y

is given. The nu-
merical solution for y(t)att = t

for n= 0, 1, 2,... . Note that the result of the ?rst calculation is used in the second, and the
result of the second calculation is used in the next repetition of step (1).
Next, let us consider the second-order differential equation
¨ y= f (y, ? y, t) (6.54)
This equation is replaced by the two ?rst-order equations
? y =v (6.55)
? v= f (y,v,t) (6.56)
with the given initial conditions y
0
andv
0
. The Euler integration method for this case
consists of the following procedure:

which is repeated at each time step.
More generally, if a system is described by a set of N coupled ?rst-order equations in
N state variables, then equations similar to (6.52) and (6.53) are used in sequence for each
of the state variables at each time step. These computed variables are then used as initial
values for the next step.

Truncation errors
Numerical integration involves the use of known data at time t
n
, and possibly at previous
times, along with the given differential equations, to estimate the values of the variables at
time t
n+1
= t
n
+ h. This is an extrapolation process. If one can represent the true solution
of a differential equation in the neighborhood of time t
n
by a Taylor series about t
n
, then the
algorithm is a representation of the truncated series, that is, its ?rst few terms. The error
due to using a limited number of terms is called the truncation error, and is expressed by
giving the ?rst omitted term or ?rst error term. The truncation error is a function of step
size h, and it approaches zero as h goes to zero.
To illustrate the nature of a truncation error, let us consider a single ?rst-order differential
equation such as (6.51), and assume that it is integrated numerically by the Euler method. We
need to distinguish between the true or exact value y
n+1
at t = t
n+1
and the corresponding
computed value y
?
n+1
. Suppose, for example, that the initial condition is y(t
0
)= y
0
and
the corresponding exact solution of the differential equation is y(t), as shown in Fig. 6.1.
Other slightly different initial conditions would result in corresponding roughly parallel
solution curves, as shown in the ?gure. The computed solution y
?
(t), however, suffers a
truncation error at each step which, in effect, transfers it to an adjacent solution curve. Thus,
as shown in Fig. 6.1 in exaggerated form, the truncation error can continue to accumulate.
The truncation error for a single step is called the local truncation error. On the other hand,
the accumulated error over a given time interval is known as the global truncation error.
Consider the use of Euler’s method in the integration of the single ?rst-order equation
? y= f (y, t) (6.60)
Assuming that there is no error in the value y
n
at time t
n
, the computed value at time t

for the Euler integration method.

E
n+1
h
=
h

¨ y(?)= O(h)( t

<?<t
n+1
) (6.66)
Because the global truncation error is of order h, the Euler method is called a ?rst-order
method.
Roundoff errors
In addition to the truncation errors which are due to the numerical integration algorithm,
there are other errors which are due to the ?nite number of digits that are used in the
computations. These are called roundoff errors. A typical situation where roundoff errors
can become important occurs when the calculations involve the small difference of large
339 Numericalintegration
numbers, in a relative sense. By subtracting the nearly equal numbers, one can lose many
signi?cant digits. Furthermore, roundoff errors become relatively more important if the
truncation errors are drastically reduced by using a very small step size.
To illustrate the nature of roundoff errors, suppose we are given y= e
t
and we desire
to calculate y
n+1
? y
n
for the case t
n
= 10 and h= 0.001. If one uses a calculator which
employs ten decimal digits, the result is
e
10.001
? e
10
= 22048.50328? 22026.46579
= 22.03749
We notice that, although the numbers to be subtracted are given to ten signi?cant digits, the
result has only seven signi?cant digits, and there is some doubt concerning the accuracy
of the last digit. In order to avoid errors due to the small difference of large numbers, one
should attempt to recast the problem in a form in which the difference is obtained directly,
possibly through a change of variables. For example, in the above problem, we notice that
y
n+1
? y
n
= (e
h
? 1)e
t n
(6.67)
and we can use a truncated series for the exponential function to obtain
e

?3
Then
y
n+1
? y
n
= 1.000500167× 22.02646579= 22.03748270
This result is accurate to the full ten digits. The improved accuracy is due to the replacement
of a difference by a product involving a convergent series.
Another example in which roundoff errors can become signi?cant occurs in dynamical
problems using Euler angles as generalized coordinates, where these coordinate values are
near a singular point. For type I Euler angles, this singular orientation occurs for the attitude
angle? near±?/2. Suppose, for example, that these Euler angles are used in writing the
dynamical equations of a rigid body. A basic physical variable in the rotational dynamics
is the angular velocity component?
x
, where
?
x
=
?
??
?
? sin? (6.68)
For the values of? near±?/2, the variables
?
? and
?
? may be very large and almost equal,
with?
x
a relatively small quantity. Thus, we have the small difference of large quantities
entering the equations of motion, and resulting in signi?cant roundoff errors. At the same
time it also may be necessary to use a small step size h in order to keep the truncation
errors under control. Perhaps the best strategy under these conditions is to avoid the use
of Euler angles altogether in the dynamical equations. Another approach such as Euler’s
rotational equations could be used for the dynamics, with the orientation being speci?ed
340 Introductiontonumericalmethods
in the kinematical equations by using four Euler parameters, which have no singularity
problems.
Trapezoidal method
Consider the ?rst-order equation
? y= f (y, t) (6.69)
The trapezoidal integration algorithm is
y
n+1
= y
n
+
1
2
h( ? y
n+1
+ ? y
n
) (6.70)
where
? y
n+1
= f (y
n+1
, t
n+1
) (6.71)
This is an implicit method because y
n+1
appears on both sides of the equation. Usually
this implies that an iterative method of solution must be used. For example, one might start
with a ?rst estimate of y
n+1
and use (6.71) to obtain a ?rst estimate of ? y
n+1
that is substituted
into (6.70) to obtain a second estimate of y
n+1
. This procedure is repeated until successive
estimates of y
n+1
are suf?ciently close, assuming that the iterative process converges. These
values are then used as initial data for the next step.
The values of y
n+1
and ? y
n+1
obtained by this iterative process are not, in general, equal
to the true values. Let us use the notation y
?
n+1
and ? y
?
n+1
for these computed values, where,
in accordance with the trapezoidal algorithm,
y
?
n+1
= y
n
+
1
2
h( ? y
?
n+1
+ ? y
n
) (6.72)
Here, y

and ? y

are assumed to be known. Now let us use a Taylor series to obtain
? y
?
n+1
? ? y
n+1
= ? y
n
+ h ¨ y
n
+

¨ y

n
+
h

¨ y

? y

(6.76)
which is of the order h

. The global truncation error is O(h

), so the trapezoidal integration
algorithm is a second-order method.
341 Numericalintegration
Modi?ed Euler method
Now let us combine the two methods we have introduced up to this point. Let us consider
a ?rst-order system
? y= f (y, t) (6.77)
with y(t
0
)= y
0
. The modi?ed Euler method,orHeun’s method,isatwo-pass method, that
is, the dynamical equation (6.77) is evaluated twice for each step. It consists of the Euler
algorithm as a predictor followed by the trapezoidal algorithm as a corrector for each step.
The method is self-starting because it requires no data for times previous to the nominal
time t
n
. It is considered to be an explicit method because there are no iterations, even though
the trapezoidal algorithm is used once per step, and we have classed the iterated trapezoidal
algorithm as implicit.
For given y
n
and t
n
, the modi?ed Euler method uses the following procedure
(1) ? y
n
= f (y
n
, t
n
) (6.78)
(2) ˜ y
n+1
= y
n
+ h ? y
n
(6.79)
(3)
˜
? y
n+1
= f (˜ y
n+1
, t
n+1
) (6.80)
(4) y
n+1
= y
n
+
1
2
h(
˜
? y
n+1
+ ? y
n
) (6.81)
We see that, in (6.79), the Euler method is used to obtain a ?rst estimate or predicted value
of y
n+1
, indicated by a tilde (?). This ˜ y
n+1
is used in (6.80) to obtain an estimated value of
? y
n+1
, which is then used in the trapezoidal formula of (6.81) to obtain the computed value
y
n+1
to be used in the following time step. This is the corrected value.
Now let us ?nd an expression for the truncation error of the modi?ed Euler method. We
begin by recalling from (6.64) that the local truncation error due to the use of the Euler
method in calculating ˜ y
n+1
is
y
n+1
? ˜ y
n+1
=
1
2
h
2
¨ y
n
(6.82)
This error will result in a corresponding error in
˜
? y
n+1
, as compared with the true value ? y
n+1
.
Assuming small errors, we ?nd that
˜
? y
n+1
= ? y
n+1
+ (˜ y
n+1
? y
n+1
) f
null n+1
(6.83)
where we use the notation f
null n+1
= (?f/?y)
n+1
. Then, using (6.81)–(6.83), we obtain the
computed value
y
?
n+1
= y

h( ? y

¨ y

(6.84)
By using Taylor expansions for y

and ? y

y

h( ? y
n+1
+ ? y

)= y
n+1
+

12
h

(6.85)
342 Introductiontonumericalmethods
Finally, we obtain the local truncation error

(

y

? 3 f

¨ y

) (6.86)
where we have substituted f
null n
for f
null n+1
since they differ by O(h).
We notice that, although the order of the local truncation error of the Euler predictor is
O(h
2
) whereas that of the trapezoidal corrector is O(h
3
), this apparent mismatch does not
result in a signi?cant loss of accuracy. As an example, consider the linear ?rst-order system
described by
? y=?y (6.87)
where? is a constant. Then ¨ y=?

y,
...
y

y, etc., and f

?

y

(6.88)
If we compare this error with that given by (6.76), we see that this error is twice as large
as the error for the fully iterated and converged trapezoidal method. The global truncation
error of the modi?ed Euler method is

for this system. Because it is of order h

,it
is classi?ed as a second-order method.
Runge–Kutta methods
The Runge–Kutta integration algorithms are characterized by being explicit, self-starting,
multiple-pass methods. Consider ?rst the second-order Runge–Kutta (RK-2) method. When
applied to the general ?rst-order system of (6.77), the RK-2 procedure is as follows:
(1) ? y

(6.92)
Notice that step (2) uses the Euler method to estimate the value of y at t
n+

. This estimate
˜ y
n+

2
is substituted into the differential equation to obtain an estimate
˜
? y

of the midpoint
velocity. In step (4), this estimate is used as an approximation of the average velocity in the
calculation of y
n+1
.
The local truncation error can be shown to be

This is an explicit, self-starting, four-pass method with a global truncation error of O(h

).
The ?rst three steps of the procedure are identical with those of the RK-2 method. Then
two more passes are added in order to improve the accuracy without requiring more initial
data at each time step.
A general analysis of the truncation error of the RK-4 method is rather complicated, but
for the case of a linear system described by ? y=?y of (6.87), it can be shown that the local

Adams–Bashforth predictors
Predictor algorithms are explicit algorithms which can be used individually or can be
coupled with correctors to form an explicit predictor–corrector combination. In general,
Adams–Bashforth (AB) predictors are not self-starting because they use past data which
is not available at the initial time. Hence, some self-starting method such as RK-4 is often
used for the ?rst few time steps before switching to the chosen predictor algorithm.
In order to obtain the various Adams–Bashforth predictors, one can ?rst recall the de?-
nition of a backward difference, as given by (6.44),
?y
n
= y

? y

(6.104)
Higher-order backward differences are de?ned by a repeated application of this operator,

The various Adams–Bashforth predictors are obtained by truncating the series of (6.105)
at corresponding points. For example, the AB-1 algorithm is identical to the Euler method
and uses only the ?rst two terms. Thus, we take
y
n+1

(6.110)

The ?rst error terms of the AM algorithms are observed to be considerably smaller than
the errors for the corresponding AB algorithms. One reason for the greater accuracy of the
AM algorithms is that they are implicit, and the values of y
n+1
are those which are achieved
after the convergence of the iteration process.

Truncation errors of predictor–corrector methods
We shall consider Adams–Bashforth predictors followed by Adams–Moulton correctors,
but with only a single pass of the corrector algorithm per step, that is, without iteration.
This leads to truncation errors of the same order in h as the corrector, but generally with a
larger coef?cient.
Let us begin with AB-1, AM-2 or the modi?ed Euler method. This algorithm has been
analyzed previously, and the local truncation error, or ?rst error term, is

as in (6.86).
Next consider the AB-2, AM-3 predictor–corrector algorithm. The AB-2 predictor results
in an estimated value of y

which is
˜ y

= y

Now apply perturbation theory at time t

? y= f (y, t) (6.135)
with the result that
˜

Thus, we ?nd that raising the order of the predictor from AB-2 to AB-3 does not change the

Finally, for the AB-3, AM-4 predictor–corrector combination, it can be shown that the

Special integration algorithms
If the differential equations are of a particular form, it may be possible to use an integration
algorithm which is especially suitable. For example, suppose that the acceleration is not a
function of velocity, that is, it has the form
¨ y= f (y, t) (6.144)
Let us look for an integration algorithm which applies directly to this second-order differ-
ential equation rather than to the equivalent set of two ?rst-order equations. Let us begin

6.3 Numerical stability
One of the recurring problems in the numerical analysis of physical systems is that the
numerical results may show an instability which is not present in the physical system. The
stability of a numerical method depends on the step size h and on the stability characteristics
of the physical system. Other factors may in?uence the stability, including the numerical
methods used in representing constraints. In this section, we will consider the numerical
stability characteristics of various integration algorithms.
Euler integration
Consider ?rst the relatively simple case of a single ?rst-order differential equation
? y= f (y, t) (6.159)
The Euler algorithm is
y
n+1
= y
n
+ h ? y
n
(6.160)
The numerical stability is analyzed by the perturbation equation
?y

?y
n
(6.161)
where we use the notation
f
null n
?
?f
?y
(y
n
, t
n
) (6.162)
We consider (6.161) as a difference equation in?y and assume that f
null n
varies slowly enough
that it can be assumed to be constant. Let
?f
?y
=? (6.163)
where? is a real constant. Then (6.161) becomes
?y
n+1
? (1+?h)?y
n
= 0 (6.164)
Now assume a solution of the form
?y
n
= A?
n
(6.165)
where A is a constant and? is the ratio?y
n+1
/?y
n
. From (6.164) and (6.165) we obtain
(?? 1??h)A?
n
= 0 (6.166)
We seek nonzero values of? in order to avoid trivial zero solutions for?y. Thus, we obtain
?= 1+?h (6.167)
The necessary condition for numerical stability is that|?|?1. The step size h is assumed
to be positive, and we see that?2??h? 0 for numerical stability.

Now let us consider the more general case of a system of m ?rst-order differential
equations which are to be integrated using the Euler method. We have
? y

d

(?y

)=? ? y
i
=??y
i
(i = 1,...,m) (6.170)
From (6.169) and (6.170), upon setting the determinant of the coef?cients of the?ys equal
to zero, we obtain the characteristic equation
det|(g
ik
???
ik
)|=0 (6.171)
where?
ik
is the Kronecker delta. There are m eigenvalues (?s) which are real or occur in
complex conjugate pairs. The perturbation equations of the physical system are stable if all
the?s lie in the left half of the complex plane, that is, if they have negative real parts.
The Euler algorithm, when applied to the perturbation equations (6.170), results in dif-
ference equations of the form
?y
i(n+1)
=?y
in
+?h?y
in
= (1+?h)?y
in
(i = 1,...,m) (6.172)
where the ?rst subscript indicates the state variable and the second subscript refers to the
time. This is consistent with (6.164) obtained earlier.
Let us assume solutions to (6.172) of the form
?y

(6.173)
Then, we obtain

The necessary condition for stability is

This result can be expressed conveniently as a plot of the stable region on the complex
plane, as shown in Fig. 6.3. If? is real, then?h must lie in the range [?2, 0] for numerical
stability. On the other hand, if? is imaginary, as it would be for an undamped second-order
system, then the Euler integration method is at least somewhat unstable, no matter how
small the step size.

Notice that? is the real eigenvalue for the linearized perturbation equation, while? is the
corresponding stability parameter for the difference equation. There is numerical stability
if|?|?1, and this will occur if the physical perturbations are stable, that is, if?? 0.
For the more general case where y in (6.177) is an m-vector, the m?s and the corre-
sponding m?s are complex in general. Nevertheless, as was shown for the case of Euler
integration, the equation relating? and? still applies. Thus, (6.183) is valid for each eigen-
value? and the corresponding?.If?= a+ ib, for example, then
?=

We see that|?|< 1fora< 0. In other words, if the physical system is stable and all its roots
are in the left half-plane, then the numerical representation using the trapezoidal method is
also stable for any step size h.
Runge–Kutta methods
Consider a ?rst-order system whose perturbation equation has the form

Now consider the more general case in which?y is an m-vector, as in (6.170). Equation

order to obtain the stability in the the complex?h-plane, we take|?|=1 and let

Furthermore, for an imaginary value of?h, as might occur in the analysis of an undamped

be seen that the RK-4 algorithm has a considerably larger region of numerical stability than

using (6.198) and (6.199), meanwhile keeping constant y

We conclude, then, that the convergence of the iteration procedure is critical in determin-
ing the range of h for overall numerical stability of the midpoint method.
Extraneous roots
When one uses higher-order algorithms such as Adams–Bashforth or Adams–Moulton, the
characteristic equation associated with the difference equations is of higher degree than
the characteristic equation obtained from the linearized differential equations describing
perturbations of the system. Thus, in addition to the roots approximating the true values,
there are additional extraneous roots introduced in the numerical solution. These extraneous
roots arise because the algorithms include values of the variables previous to time t

As a speci?c example, let?h=? 0.1. The corresponding characteristic equation is
?

? 0.85?? 0.05= 0 (6.216)
and the roots are?
1,2
= 0.9052,?0.0552. If the numerical procedure were exact, then we
should have?= e
?h
= 0.9048. Thus, we see that the root?0.0552 is extraneous.
As another example, let?h=? 1 which is on the boundary of the stable region. The
characteristic roots in this case are?= 0.5,?1. The root?1 is on the stability boundary
and is extraneous. Thus, it is the extraneous root which causes numerical instability for
more negative values of?h.
In general, the number of extraneous roots is determined by the number of time increments
in the past at which data are used in the algorithm. For example, the AB-3 algorithm involves
? y
n?2
. This results in two extraneous roots for each variable, assuming ?rst-order differential
equations.
For multiple-pass algorithms such as the various predictor–corrector methods, the algo-
rithm as a whole determines the number of extraneous roots. For example, the AB-3, AM-4
combination involves ? y
n?2
and will introduce two extraneous roots per variable.
6.4 Frequency response methods
Transfer functions
Consider a linear time-invariant system which has a sinusoidal input. The steady-state
output will be sinusoidal with the same frequency as the input but, in general, with a
different amplitude and phase. If one uses complex notation, the amplitude and phase of
the output relative to the input are expressed by the transfer function
G(i?)= Me
i?
(6.217)
where M(?) is the relative amplitude and?(?) is the relative phase.
The system under consideration may be originally linear or may be a linearized system
which is represented by a set of perturbation equations. The data resulting from a numerical
integration of the linear equations can be considered to be samples taken from a continuous

output, albeit an output slightly in error compared to the true output. The transfer function
relating this computed output to the same sinusoidal input is of the form
G
?
(i?)= M
?
e
i?
?
(6.218)
where M
?
and?
?
are functions of?. Our problem is to ?nd the relationship of G
?
(i?)t o
G(i?) for some combination of linear equations and integration algorithm.
As a simple example, consider apureintegrator with a unit sinusoidal input. Its differential
equation can be written in the complex form
? y= e
i?t
(6.219)
Let us use the Euler integration algorithm and the discrete time
t
n
= nh (6.220)
We obtain the difference equation
y
n+1
= y
n
+ he
i?nh
(6.221)
The steady-state solution of this equation has the form
y
n
= G
?
(i?)e
i?nh
(6.222)
where G
?
(i?) is complex, in general. This solution is sinusoidal and of the same frequency
as the input, but G
?
(i?) allows for a different amplitude and phase at the output y
n
.
If (6.222) is substituted into (6.221), we obtain

?
(i?)= he

or

(6.223)
Compare this result with that for the integrator of (6.219) where
G(i?)=
1
i?
(6.224)
We see that one can obtain G
?
(i?) from G(i?) by replacing i? with (e
i?h
? 1)/h. This
substitution is valid for any transfer function G(i?) if Euler integration is used.
In general, if one knows the transfer operator G(s), where s is the Laplacian variable,
then one obtains G(i?) by the substitution s= i?. G
?
(i?) is obtained by letting s=
(e
i?h
? 1)/h for the case of Euler integration.
As a second example, suppose we again consider an integrator with a sinusoidal input,
as given by (6.219), and use the RK-2 algorithm. The resulting difference equation is

We note that as the step size h approaches zero, G

(6.224).
It is important to realize that, for multiple-pass algorithms such as RK-2, one can no
longer obtain G
?
(i?) by making the appropriate substituting for s in G(s). The form
of G
?
(i?) is complicated by the presence of intermediate variables in making extra
passes.

where the latter form gives the amplitude and the phase angle in radians relative to the

Suppose we solve this problem using Euler integration with a step size h= 0.01. If we
replace i? by (e

We see that the steady-state amplitude of the numerical solution is about one percent too
large. The numerical phase lag is more accurate but is also slightly large.
Example 6.2 Now consider a ?rst-order system which is analyzed using the RK-2 al-
gorithm. We desire the steady-state response to a unit sinusoidal input. The differential

Note that G

Let us consider a numerical example with?=? 1,?= 1 and h= 0.01. With these

360 Introductiontonumericalmethods
The result for continuous time is
G= 0.707107?? 0.785398
We see that the sinusoidal response using RK-2 is slightly small both in amplitude and in
phase lag compared to the true values.
Free sinusoidal response
The effects of truncation errors are most readily apparent in the numerical analysis of
systems having neutral stability. For these systems, any change in damping due to the
integration algorithm appears as a sinusoidal oscillation which is growing or shrinking in
amplitude.
As an illustrative example, consider a linear second-order system described by

The errors in amplitude and phase are shown in Table 6.1. It is interesting to note that
the methods with odd orders of accuracy in h tend to be more accurate in phase, while the
methods of even order in h are relatively more accurate in amplitude. On an absolute basis,
the RK-4 method is quite accurate in both amplitude and phase.
The last column represents the amplitude of the computed solution after one complete
cycle of the oscillation, consisting of approximately 63 time steps. We see that the Euler
solution has increased in amplitude by about 37%, while the amplitude of the RK-4 solution
has an error of less than one part in a million in the analysis of this neutrally stable system.
6.5 Kinematic constraints
An important consideration in the numerical analysis of dynamical systems lies in the proper
representation of kinematical constraints. Even if the physical system is stable, there may
be numerical instabilities resulting from the method of applying constraints. In this section,
we shall present methods of representing constraints and will analyze their stability.
Baumgarte’s method for holonomic constraints
Let us consider ?rst a dynamical system which is subject to m holonomic constraints of the
form
?
j
(q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (6.284)
Suppose there are n second-order dynamical equations written in the fundamental La-
grangian form

i
(q, ? q, t)( i = 1,...,n) (6.285)
365 Kinematicconstraints
where the?s are Lagrange multipliers, the Qs are generalized applied forces, and where
a
ji
(q, t)=
??
j
?q
i
(6.286)
At this point there are n dynamical equations which are linear in the n ¨ qs and the m?s.
We need m additional equations to solve for the variables. These additional equations can
be obtained by differentiating the constraint equations twice with respect to time. First,
?
?
j
=
n
null i=1
a
ji
(q, t) ? q
i
+ a
jt
(q, t) (6.287)
where
a
jt
(q, t)=
??
j
?t
(6.288)
Then
¨
?
j
has the form
¨
?
j
=
n
null i=1
a
ji
(q, t)¨ q
i
+ G
j
(q, ? q, t)( j = 1,...,m) (6.289)
If these expressions for
¨
?
j
are set equal to zero then, with the aid of (6.285), one can
solve for the ¨ q
i
(q, ? q, t) and?
j
(q, ? q, t). The n ¨ q
i
expressions can be integrated numerically
for given initial conditions, thereby obtaining ? q
i
and q
i
as functions of time.
The problem with this approach is that the resulting numerical solutions will be unstable
even though the physical system may actually be stable. This instability arises from the fact
that, in effect, each constraint equation in the differentiated form
¨
?
j
=0( j = 1,...,m) (6.290)
is also being integrated twice with respect to time. This equation has a repeated zero
characteristic root and is therefore unstable.
In order to stabilize the numerical representation of holonomic constraints, Baumgarte
proposed that (6.290) be changed to
¨
?
j
+?
?
?
j
+??
j
=0( j = 1,...,m) (6.291)
where? and? are suitably chosen constants whose values may depend on the step size h.
This allows the roots of the corresponding characteristic equation to be shifted to the left
half-plane where the constraint response can be heavily damped.
In detail, the Baumgarte procedure for a system having holonomic constraints is as
follows:

(6.299)
This corresponds to critical damping of the constraint error?

which may be nonzero. The
constraint errors are driven primarily by truncation errors associated with the numerical
integration algorithm. Hence, they will not disappear entirely, even with the stabilization
procedure.
The numerical stability of a particular constraint function?(q) can be analyzed by con-
sidering the integration algorithm to be applied directly to the Baumgarte equation

If we take? proportional to 1/h and? proportional to 1/h
2
, the roots of the characteristic
equation are independent of the step size. This means that the numerical stability of the
solution for the constraint function?(q) is also independent of the step size. As an example,
suppose we choose?= 2/h and? = 1/h
2
. Then the characteristic equation (6.307) has a
double zero root, indicating a “deadbeat” response. This means that, in theory, the constraint
error? should go to zero in one step, provided that the initial conditions (at n= 0) are
in accordance with the A/B ratio of the corresponding eigenvector. For arbitrary initial
conditions and the given values of? and?, the error will go to zero in two steps, in
theory. In the actual case, however, the constraint error does not go to zero because of new
disturbances at each step due to truncation and roundoff errors.
Example 6.3 A particle of mass m moves on a frictionless rigid wire in the form of a
horizontal circle of radius R (Fig. 6.5). The equation of constraint in terms of Cartesian
coordinates is

nomic constraints have the form
g
j
(q, ? q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (6.329)
where g

is not necessarily linear in the ? qs, we can write Lagrange’s equation as follows:

Note that (6.330) reduces to (6.285) for the usual case in which the nonholonomic constraint

The Baumgarte method for nonholonomic constraints is similar to the holonomic case,
except that the nonholonomic constraint function g

(q, ? q,U, t)( i = 1,...,n) (6.335)
The Us are given by (6.332). Usually the dynamical equations are written as 2n ?rst-order
equations.
In general,? should be chosen to be inversely proportional to h, and? should be inversely
proportional to h
2
. Acceptable accuracy can be obtained with? set equal to zero. For
improved accuracy, however, one should choose? to be nonzero at the cost of an additional
numerical integration for each constraint.
Example6.4 Let us apply the Baumgarte method to a nonholonomic system whose dynam-
ics have been analyzed previously. In these instances, however, the question of numerical
stability was not considered.
The system consists of two particles, each of mass m, which are connected by a massless
rod of length l, and which move on the horizontalxy-plane. There is a knife-edge constraint
at particle 1, as shown in Fig. 6.6, resulting in a nonholonomic constraint of the form
g(q, ? q)=? ? x sin?+ ? y cos?= 0 (6.336)
This equation states that the velocity component of particle 1 in a direction normal to the
rod is always zero.

?= m(? x

These equations are integrated numerically. For the unstabilized case (U = 0), it can be
shown that (6.349)–(6.351) are equivalent to (4.31)–(4.33) which were obtained earlier by
using Maggi’s equations. One can conclude that the differentiated constraint equation (4.33)
would result in numerical instability unless there is stabilization by some method such as
that of Baumgarte.
One-step method for holonomic constraints
Although the Baumgarte method works quite well in stabilizing kinematic constraints, one
can improve the accuracy of constraint representations by using a one-step method. The
improvement is particularly noticeable when there is more than one constraint. When the
Baumgarte method is used, for example, there is the possibility that the terms added to
stabilize a given constraint may actually increase the error of a second constraint. Thus,
there is an interaction of corrective efforts.
The goal of the one-step method is to completely eliminate the constraint errors at the
end of each time step, insofar as the constraint linearizations are valid. In practice, this
means that if relatively small truncation and roundoff errors occur with each step, then the
constraint accuracy will be excellent. Another consideration is that the corrections should
be made in a direction in con?guration space such that the dynamical response of the system
will not be altered appreciably.
The procedure for the one-step method begins in a manner similar to the Baumgarte
method. The equations of motion are written with the aid of Lagrange multipliers, and
then are solved for the accelerations ¨ q
i
(q, ? q,?,t), where i = 1,...,n. The m holonomic
373 Kinematicconstraints
constraint functions are differentiated twice with respect to time, with the result
¨
?
j
(q, ? q, ¨ q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (6.352)
Then then ¨ q expressions obtained from the dynamical equations are substituted into (6.352).
These m equations are solved for the m Lagrange multipliers?
j
(q, ? q, t) which are then
substituted back into the ¨ q expressions. At this point,we haven dynamical equations without
?s, namely,
¨ q
i
= ¨ q
i
(q, ? q, t)( i = 1,...,n) (6.353)
These equations are identical with (6.335) of the Baumgarte method, except that all the Us
have been set equal to zero. The n equations are integrated numerically and, at each time
step, a one-step error correction takes place.
In order to explain the geometric aspects of the one-step error correction method, let us
consider ?rst the case of a single holonomic constraint
?(q, t)= 0 (6.354)
This constraint can be represented as a surface in con?guration space (q-space). The con-
?guration point P, whose position is given by the n-vectorq, must move on the constraint
surface if the constraint equation (6.354) is satis?ed exactly. But, in general, the value of
the constraint function? will not be exactly zero at the end of each step. It needs to be
corrected to zero. To accomplish this, ?rst ?nd the gradient vector
??=
null ??
?q
1
,...,
??
?q
n
null T
(6.355)
where the axes are orthogonal in n-space. In an effort to minimize the effect of the constraint
correction on other aspects of the solution such as periods or damping, let us arbitrarily
choose a correction vectornull q of minimum length. Assuming a small constraint error, this
implies that the correction should be made in a direction normal to the constraint surface
in n-space, that is, in the direction of the gradient??. So let us choose
null q
i
= C
??
?q
i
(i = 1,...,n) (6.356)
where C is a constant whose value is found from the condition that the correction should
exactly cancel the constraint errors. Thus, we require that

These corrections are applied at the end of each time step. If a multiple-pass algorithm is
used, it is still preferable to make the correction once per step rather than once per pass.
Now let us generalize the results to the case of m holonomic constraints of the form
?
j
(q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (6.360)
The solution vectorq(t)mustmo v einthe( n? m)-dimensional space formed by the com-
mon intersection of the m constraint surfaces. This is visualized most easily for the case of
two constraints in a three-dimensional space, as shown in Fig. 6.7. Here the operating point
P does not lie in either constraint surface, although it should lie on their line of intersection
OO
null if the constraints are to be satis?ed exactly.
The correction vectornull q= PC is chosen to be orthogonal to OO
null and is expressed as
a linear combination of the gradient vectors??

corrections that are added to the corresponding qs.
The procedure will usually result in very small constraint errors at the end of each time
step, provided that the linearization assumptions are valid. A problem remains, however.
It arises because although the? functions are all approximately equal to zero, the corre-
sponding constraint error rates (
?
?s) are not necessarily zero, and may actually increase in
magnitude as the integration proceeds. To avoid this possible dif?culty, let us use a similar
one-step procedure to correct the velocities in a manner such that all the
?
?s go to zero. In
other words, the correctionnull ? q in velocity space is formed of a linear combination of the
gradient vectors of the individual
?
? functions.

Notice that the coef?cients of the K s in (6.376) are identical with the coef?cients of the
Cs found earlier in (6.370). Thus, the solution for the K s is relatively easy. Knowing the
values of the K s, one obtains the velocity corrections from (6.375).
To summarize, the one-step method proceeds by ?rst obtaining the dynamical equations
in the form of (6.353), that is, after eliminating the Lagrange multipliers and solving for
the individual accelerations (¨ qs) as functions of (q, ? q, t). These equations are integrated
numerically. At the end of each time step, the one-step corrections are made, ?rst thenull q

A comparison of the numerical results obtained by using the Baumgarte method or the
one-step method of representing holonomic constraints shows that the one-step method is
much more accurate, although either method may be acceptable for a relatively small step
size. On the other hand, the two methods show about the same accuracy with respect to
the time response, as measured by the period. Time errors are determined primarily by
truncation errors associated with the integration algorithm.
One-step method for nonholonomic constraints
The procedure for applying the one-step method to systems with nonholonomic constraints
begins in the same way as with the Baumgarte method, except that the Us are set equal to
zero. Thus, assuming m nonholonomic constraints of the form
g
j
(q, ? q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (6.412)
one can write the dynamical equations as in (6.330), namely,
d

(q, ? q, t)( i = 1,...,n) (6.413)
Next, differentiate the constraint functions with respect to time, obtaining
? g
j
(q, ? q, ¨ q, t)=0( j = 1,...,m) (6.414)
One can solve the n equations of (6.413) for the n ¨ qs as functions of (q, ? q,?,t) and these
expressions are then substituted into (6.414), obtaining m equations which are linear in the
380 Introductiontonumericalmethods
?s. After solving these equations for?
j
(q, ? q, t), (j = 1,...,m), we substitute back into
the ¨ q expressions to obtain the ?nal dynamical equations of the form
¨ q
i
= ¨ q
i
(q, ? q, t)( i = 1,...,n) (6.415)
At this point, we should explain that another method such as Maggi’s equation plus (6.414)
might be used in obtaining (6.415).
The n second-order dynamical equations can be converted to 2n ?rst-order equations
which are integrated numerically. At the end of each step, we wish to apply a one-step
correction to the solution. The fact that the system is nonholonomic results in an impor-
tant difference in the correction strategy, as compared to the holonomic case. Due to the
nonintegrable nature of the constraints, there is no direct way of detecting errors in the
con?guration, that is, the qs. On the other hand, for any given con?guration, velocity errors
result in a separation of the solution point from the constraint surface in velocity space.
These errors can be detected and corrections made to the ? qs. Another reason for this ap-
proach is the fact that, at least for holonomic systems, errors in the
?
?s tend to be much
larger than con?guration errors as measured by the?s. In other words, the errors in the ? qs
tend to be larger than errors in the qs due to the smoothing effect of the integration process.
Our approach, then, will be to make one-step corrections in a manner similar to the velocity
corrections for holonomic constraints.
First, we require that the velocity correction vector be a linear combination of the indi-
vidual constraint gradient vectors in velocity space.

Example 6.6 Let us consider once again a nonholonomic system consisting of a dumb-
bell sliding on a horizontal plane and constrained by a knife edge at one of the particles
(Fig. 6.6). The nonholonomic constraint equation is
g
1
(q, ? q)=? ? x sin?+ ? y cos?= 0 (6.419)
381 Kinematicconstraints
which states that the transverse velocity at particle 1 is equal to zero. Following the procedure
of Example 6.4 on page 370 for the case in whichU = 0, we obtain the dynamical equations:
¨ x =

¨
?=?

(? x cos?+ ? y sin?) (6.422)
The equations are integrated numerically. At the end of each time step, the nonholonomic
constraint function g

is evaluated. From (6.418), we ?nd that
K (sin
2
?+ cos
2
?)=? g
1
(6.423)
or
K=? g

(6.424)
Then, from (6.416), the one-step velocity corrections are
null ? x=? g
1
sin? (6.425)
null ? y = g
1
cos? (6.426)
null ?
? = 0 (6.427)
Thus, at the end of each time step in the numerical integration, the value of the nonholonomic
constraint function is approximately zero.
A comparison of constraint enforcement methods
If the given holonomic and nonholonomic examples are analyzed numerically for typi-
cal cases, some observations and conclusions can be made. For the holonomic system of
Example 6.5 on page 376, the results are much more accurate for the one-step method than
for the Baumgarte method. This is particularly true of the velocities and amounts to about
two additional decimal digits of accurate data for the same step size, using the RK-2 algo-
rithm. The con?guration accuracy is also much superior for the one-step method, although
both methods show satisfactory accuracy for a relatively small step size. A comparison of
computing times shows that the one-step method requires about one-third more time for the
same step size.
If one compares the Baumgarte and one-step methods, as they are applied to nonholo-
nomic systems such as Example 6.6 on page 380, the one-step method again provides
superior accuracy. Both methods, however, exhibit some loss of accuracy for nonholo-
nomic constraints. This arises because there is no direct way of detecting con?guration
errors for nonholonomic systems as the computation proceeds.
A comparison of the solution accuracies of the two methods with respect to time shows
roughly the same accuracy. This occurs because time accuracy is not closely related to con-
?guration accuracy. Rather, the time aspect of the computations, as indicated by the period
382 Introductiontonumericalmethods
of the motion, for example, is strongly in?uenced by the choice of the integration algorithm
and the step size. The truncation errors are the most important factor. For conservative
systems such as we have been studying, the overall accuracy can be improved by making
further corrections based on energy errors. These errors tend to appear as velocity errors
whose magnitudes increase with time. This affects the periods and other important charac-
teristics of the motion. The use of energy methods in improving computational accuracy
will be considered in Section 6.6.
Euler parameter constraints
The four Euler parameters (null x
,null
y
,null
z
,? ) were introduced in Section 3.1 as generalized
coordinates to represent the orientation of a rigid body relative to some frame, usually an
inertial frame. Since a rigid body has only three rotational degrees of freedom, there must
be an equation of constraint relating the Euler parameters. It is the holonomic constraint

2
? 1= 0 (6.428)
In accordance with (3.80), the Euler parameters are generated by the numerical integration
of four ?rst-order kinematical equations, namely,
?null x

The body-axis angular velocity components (?

) are obtained by the numerical
integration of the rotational equations of motion.
Let us use the one-step method to correct any constraint errors. First, calculate the gradient
vector in q-space at the operating point.
??= [2null x

(6.433)
Next, we require the correction vectornull q to exactly compensate for the constraint error at
the end of each time step, that is,
??·null q=?? (6.434)
where
null q= C?? (6.435)
Thus, we take the correction vector in the direction of the gradient??. From (6.434) and
(6.435), the coef?cient C is

Note that this correctionnull q does not change the direction of the con?guration vectorq in

The correction of the Euler parameter values does not cause a risk of numerical instability
because, in the usual case of rigid body motion, the Euler parameter values do not enter the
dynamical equations. Thus, there is no need to set
?
? or
¨
? equal to zero, thereby avoiding
tendencies toward numerical instability. Instead, the dynamical equations are written in
terms of quasi-velocities (?s) and the Euler parameter calculations for the orientation are
performed separately.
6.6 Energy and momentum methods
In assessing the accuracy of numerically computed solutions of the equations of motion
of a dynamical system, it is helpful to have relatively simple check solutions available. A
common approach is to use integrals of the motion, that is, functions whose values remain
constant during the course of the solution, as checks on accuracy. For example, the energy
integral E = T
2
? T
0
+ V may be used for conservative systems. Other systems may have
one or more components of momentum or angular momentum conserved. Integrals of the
motion are particularly effective in detecting programming errors. Of course, these methods
are ineffective against errors in the values of the physical parameters.
Energy corrections
Let us consider a conservative system whose energy integral has the form
E(q, ? q)= T
2
? T
0
+ V = E
0
(6.438)
At each time step in the numerical solution, we wish to correct for an energy errornull E
given by
null E = E? E
0
(6.439)
where E
0
is evaluated from the initial conditions.
First let us note that, for a given con?guration and energy constant E
0
, the equation
E(q, ? q)? E
0
= 0 (6.440)
represents a surface in n-dimensional velocity space (Fig. 6.9). Since the kinetic energy
function T (q, ? q) is positive de?nite and quadratic in the ? qs, the form of the energy surface
is ellipsoidal for the particular case of 3-space.
The velocity correctionnull ? q will be taken in the direction normal to the energy surface,
that is, in the direction of the gradient?E or?T . In accordance with the one-step method,

let us assume that
null ? q= K?T (6.441)
and choose the value of K such that
?T ·null ? q=?null E (6.442)
which results in the exact cancellation of the energy error. Thus, we obtain

The individual velocity corrections are

(i = 1,...,n) (6.444)
If the conservative system is subject to kinematic constraints, the corresponding constraint
surfaces in velocity space are typically planes passing through the origin. The velocity vector
? q is constrained to lie in the common intersection of these planes. Any velocity correction
is taken in a direction normal to ? q. But from Fig. 6.9 we see that the velocity correctionnull ? q
for an energy error is approximately the same direction as ? q. (It is exactly the same direction
if the energy surface is spherical.) Thus, the velocity corrections for constraint errors and
energy errors are approximately normal to each other and do not interact very strongly.
From (6.443) and (6.444), we see thatnull ? q can be quite large if the magnitude of ? q or
the generalized momentum vector is very small. For most dynamical systems, this will not
occur. But if the kinetic energy T
2
does attain a small value compared to its maximum during
the motion of the conservative system, then signi?cant errors in the correctionsnull ? q
i
can
occur because the linear theory assumes small perturbations. In this case, it is preferable to
make the corrections in con?guration space rather than velocity space, so long as T
2
and ? q
remain small.
385 Energyandmomentummethods
Proceeding, then, along these lines, we can write
E = T
2
+ V
null = E
0
(6.445)
where
V
null (q)= V ? T
0
(6.446)
Then, using a similar analysis, and taking the correctionnull q in the direction of the gradient
of V

(i = 1,...,n) (6.447)
When T
2
is no longer small, it is preferable to return to corrections in velocity space since
velocity errors tend to be larger.
If the kinetic energy is expressed in terms of quasi-velocities (us) rather than true ve-
locities ( ? qs), the analysis proceeds similarly to that resulting in (6.443) and (6.444). Thus,
substituting u

Work and energy
We have been concerned with numerical checks and corrections as they are applied to
conservative systems. Now let us extend the theory to nonconservative systems. We shall
consider two basic methods.
386 Introductiontonumericalmethods
First method
Let us apply the principle of work and kinetic energy to a system of N rigid bodies. The
velocity of the reference point P
i
of the ith body isv
i
and its angular velocity is?
i
. The total
effect of all the forces, including constraint forces, which act on the ith body are equivalent
to a forceF
i
acting at the reference point plus a couple of momentM
i
. Then, since
?
T =
?
W (6.452)
where, from (4.357),
?
W =
N
null i=1
(F
i
·v
i
+M
i

i
) (6.453)
we can integrate with respect to time to obtain
null T =
null t 2
t 1
N
null i=1
(F
i
·v
i
+M
i
·?
i
)dt (6.454)
At any time t
2
, this value ofnull T can be used as a check by comparing it with a value of
null T obtained from the solution of the differential equations. To be effective, the separate
integration given by (6.454) must be at least as accurate as thenull T obtained from the
numerical solution of the equations of motion.
If a portion of F
i
and of M
i
arise from a potential energy function V (q, t), but F
null i
and
M
null i
are the portions that are not due to potential energy, then in accordance with (4.364) we
can write
null (T + V )=
null t 2
t 1
null N
null i=1
(F
null i
·v
i
+M
null i
·?
i
)+
?V
?t
null dt (6.455)
This calculation can also be used as a check on the numerical solution of differential
equations.
The above approach is relatively direct and effective when it is applicable. It turns out,
however, thatF
null i
andM
null i
frequently include unknown constraint forces.
Second method
Another approach is to make energy checks using the energy integral E = T
2
? T
0
+ V
rather than the total energy T + V . Consider a nonholonomic system consisting of N rigid
bodies, with a kinetic energy T (q, u, t) and potential energy V (q, t). Suppose there are n
qs and m constraints. The n ? qs and (n? m) us are related by

This result can be used as a numerical check on the accuracy ofnull E found from the
numerical integration of the equations of motion. For the usual case of ideal constraints
and independent us, the Q

generalized forces will not involve constraint forces, and thus
will be known functions or equal to zero. Note that ? ?

represent linear or angular
accelerations when all the us are set equal to zero, that is, they generally appear only if there
are moving constraints. Thus, in spite of the apparent complexity, (6.460) is often relatively
easy to evaluate.
Example 6.8 Let us consider work and energy relationships for a rheonomic system
consisting of a top whose point is constrained to move uniformly around a horizontal circle
of radius r (Fig. 6.10). The con?guration is given by type II Euler angles. Let us choose

angular velocity of the point P along its path is?
0
. Theijkunit vectors are as shown,
withi remaining horizontal andjkde?ning a vertical plane. Since the motion of the point
P is known, the easiest approach is to consider that point ?xed, and then apply a horizontal
inertial force at the center of mass due to the actual acceleration of P. With this assumption,
the velocity of the center of mass is linear and homogeneous in the us, so

in obtaining the expression for
?
E). The integration of
?
E is accomplished concurrently with
the integration of the equations of motion, and E is considered as an extra variable. This
check will detect most programming errors.
Conservation of momentum
One can use momentum-like integrals of the motion to improve the accuracy of numerical
solutions of the equations of motion for dynamical systems. A common approach, when
it applies, is to use the Routhian method, as discussed in Chapter 2. This method applies
to systems described by the standard holonomic form of Lagrange’s equation, and which
have one or more ignorable coordinates, that is, coordinates which do not appear in the
Lagrangian function although the corresponding ? qs do appear. For example, if there are k
ignorable coordinates, then there are k integrals of the motion having the form
?L
? ? q
i
=?
i
(i = 1,...,k) (6.473)
where the?s are constants and?L/? ? q
i
is a generalized momentum. The Routhian method
proceeds by de?ning the Routhian function
R(q, ? q, t)= L?

?

(6.474)
390 Introductiontonumericalmethods
where the k ignorable ? qs have been eliminated by solving for them from the k equations of
(6.473) and then substituting into (6.474). The (n? k) differential equations of motion are
obtained from

(i = k+ 1,...,n) (6.476)
We see from (6.475) that the effective number of degrees of freedom is reduced to (n? k),
thereby simplifying the analysis, particularly if one is not interested in solving for the time
history of the ignored coordinates. It should be noted from (6.474) that one cannot simply
use (6.473) to eliminate the ignorable ? qs from the Lagrangian function and then continue
to use the standard form of Lagrange’s equations. This results in incorrect equations of
motion. The reason is that the standard Lagrange’s equations require that L(q, ? q, t) contain
a full set of n independent ? qs if the holonomic system has n kinematic degrees of freedom.
So-called momentum or energy constraints do not reduce the number of kinematic degrees
of freedom.
In addition to the Routhian method, there are other approaches which use conservation
of momentum to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the dynamical analysis.
For example, isolated systems such as dynamical systems in space will have conservation
of both linear and angular momentum. Since each is a vector quantity in 3-space, if one
considers the Cartesian components of each vector, there are immediately available six
integrals of the motion. The conservation of linear momentum implies that the center of
mass of the system translates with constant velocity. Therefore, one can ?nd an inertial
frame in which the center of mass is ?xed. By using this reference frame and choosing the
generalized coordinates accordingly, one can reduce the number of degrees of freedom in
the dynamical analysis by three. A similar reduction in the rotational degrees of freedom
is not necessarily available because any rotating frame is noninertial. Nevertheless, special
situations such as planar rotational motion can be used to simplify the analysis.
Angular momentumcorrections
The Routhian method of reducing the effective degrees of freedom does not apply if the
kinetic energy is expressed in terms of quasi-velocities. But quasi-velocities are commonly
used in the rotational analysis of rigid bodies; that is, the angular velocity of a rigid body is
expressed in terms of its body-axis components, and these components are quasi-velocities.
If one considers the free rotational motion of a rigid body, there is conservation of angular
momentum, and this can be used to correct errors and improve the accuracy of numerical
solutions for its motion.
The simplest approach is to correct for amplitude errors only rather than correcting the
three angular momentum components separately. The form of the square of the angular
391 Energyandmomentummethods
momentum magnitude is quadratic in the us. In that respect, it resembles a kinetic energy
function, and it can be treated similarly.
As an example, consider a rigid body that is rotating in free space. Let us choose the
square of the angular momentum magnitude as an integral of the motion, that is,
P(?)= I

(6.477)
We assume principal axes at the center of mass, and H
0
is the constant magnitude of the
angular momentum.
The function P(?) represents an ellipsoid in three-dimensional velocity space (?-space)
and is called the momentum ellipsoid. As the rotational motion proceeds the vector ?,
drawn from the origin of the body-?xed frame, moves such that its point always lies on
the momentum ellipsoid. Due to numerical errors, however, the computed value of? may
lie on an ellipsoid with a slightly different value of H
2
, corresponding to an error in the
angular momentum integral
null P = H
2
? H

(6.478)
The correctionnull ? is made in a direction normal to the momentum ellipsoid at the
operating point, that is, in the direction of the gradient. This minimizes the magnitude of the
correctionnull ? resulting in the required correctionnull H in angular momentum magnitude.
Thus, we take
null ?= K?P (6.479)

(6.484)
which is the equation of an ellipsoid in body-?xed?-space. It is called the energy ellipsoid.
Since both the angular momentum and the kinetic energy are conserved, the angular velocity
must satisfy (6.477) and (6.484). In other words, the point of the?-vector must move on
the curve de?ned by the intersection of the momentum and energy ellipsoids. This closed
curve in body-?xed?-space is called a polhode. Thus, for general initial conditions, the
path of the?-vector relative to body axes is periodic. On the other hand, the path of? in
inertial space is not periodic in the general case of rigid body motion.
Example 6.9 Consider the planar motion of a solid cylinder of mass m and radius r as it
moves in the xy-plane (Fig. 6.11). An inextensible string is wound around a cylinder and the
straight portion OP has a variable length l. We wish to obtain the differential equations of
motion and establish correction procedures based on the conservation of energy and angular
momentum.
First, notice that the angular velocity of the cylinder is

(6.485)
where

the angular velocity of the cylinder relative to the unit vectors. The velocityv of the center
of the cylinder is equal to the velocity of the tangent point P, ?xed in the string, plus the
velocity of C relative to P. Thus, we obtain

Because the motion is planar, this is a scalar equation. For this reason, we can correct
