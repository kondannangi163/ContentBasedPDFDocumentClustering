Hunger Games Alternate Ending





"We both cant win, Katniss" said Peeta. "Yes we can... We just need to find a way to make us both win" said Katniss. Then Katniss sat down and started to think. Then Peeta said "Stop thinking, it will get you no where. Just wait a few hours and I will be gone. Im loosing to much blood to be saved. Go on, get yourself cleaned up for when they come and get you. You always were a champion, now go show the world the fierce Katniss Everdeen." "NO! not without you, Peeta" said Katniss. Then she takes the last arrow and shoves it through her stomach. "No. Don't Kaniss, please don't" Peeta cried. Then Katniss fell over and murmered her final words "I love you Peeta. Now go show everyone the real champion". "NOOOOO" screamed Peeta. Then the cannon went off signaling Katniss's death. "Congratulations to the Hunger Games Winner, Peeta Mellark!" Then the hovercraft came and took Peeta to go get healed.





Multiple years later Peeta followed his mentor's path and became an alchoholic. Not because he was rich but because he was diagnosed with deep depression only six months after the games. When everyone asked why he used the excuse "I saw many people die and it had a huge effect on me" but only Peeta knew the real reason. He missed Katniss. Every day he regrets watching her die. He still believes that he could have stopped her from killing herself. A couple of years after that he wished for death but never got it. Luckily many many years later he eventually did die of only age and finally after many years of waiting he got to be with his true love, Katniss.
