undergraduate courses in thermodynamics taught in the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. Most of the students in this course
are juniors or seniors majoring in aerospace or mechanical engineering. The objective of the
course is to survey both practical and theoretical problems in classical thermodynamics.
The notes draw heavily on the text specified for the course, Borgnakke and Sonntag’s
(BS) Fundamentals of Thermodynamics, Seventh Edition, John Wiley, New York, 2009, especially Chapters 10-16. In general the nomenclature of BS is used, and much of the notes
follow a similar structure as that text. In addition, Abbott and van Ness’s Thermodynamics,
McGraw-Hill, New York, 1972, has been used to guide some of the mathematical developments. Many example problems have been directly taken from BS and other texts; specific
citations are given where they arise. Many of the unique aspects of these notes, which focus
on thermodynamics of reactive gases with detailed finite rate kinetics, have arisen due to
the author’s involvement in research supported by the National Science Foundation under
Grant No. CBET-0650843. The author is grateful for the support. Any opinions, findings,
and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author and
do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.
These notes emphasize both problem-solving as well as some rigorous undergraduatelevel development of the underlying classical theory; the student should call on textbooks
and other reference materials to fill some of the gaps. It should also be remembered that
practice is essential to the learning process; the student would do well to apply the techniques
presented here by working as many problems as possible.
The notes, along with information on the course, can be found on the world wide web at
http://www.nd.edu/∼powers/ame.50531. At this stage, anyone is free to make copies for
their own use. I would be happy to hear from you about suggestions for improvement.

– intensive: independent of system’s extent, lower case variables (exceptions are
temperature T and pressure P , which are intensive). Intensive properties can be
on a mass basis or a molar basis:
specific volume, SI-based units are m3 /kg,
specific internal energy, SI-based units are kJ/kg,
specific enthalpy, SI-based units are kJ/kg,
specific entropy, SI-based units are kJ/kg/K.
molar specific volume, SI-based units are m3 /kmole,
molar specific internal energy, SI-based units are kJ/kmole,
molar specific enthalpy, SI-based units are kJ/kmole,
molar specific entropy, SI-based units are kJ/kmole/K.

• density: ρ = 1/v, mass per unit volume, SI-based units are kg/m3 .
• equations of state: relate properties
– Calorically Perfect Ideal Gas (CPIG) has P v = RT and u − uo =
cv (T − To ),

CHAPTER 1. REVIEW
– Calorically Imperfect Ideal Gas (CIIG) has P v = RT and u − uo =
RT
c (T̂ ) dT̂ .
To v

– Non-ideal state equations have P = P (T, v), u = u(T, v).

• Any intensive thermodynamic property can be expressed as a function of at most two
other intensive thermodynamic properties (for simple compressible systems).
– P = RT /v: thermal equation of state for ideal gas, SI-based units are kP a.
√
– c = kP v: sound speed for CPIG, SI-based units are m/s; k = cP /cv , the ratio
of specific heats.
• energy: E = U + (1/2)m(v · v) + mgz, total energy = internal+kinetic+potential.
• first law: dE = δQ − δW ; if kinetic and potential are ignored, dU = δQ − δW ; with
δQ = T dS and δW = P dV , we get the Gibbs equation dU = T dS − P dV .
• second law: dS ≥ δQ/T .
• process: moving from one state to another, in general with accompanying heat transfer and work.
• cycle: process which returns to initial state.
R2
• specific reversible work: 1 w2 = 1 P dv; δw = P dv.
R2
• specific reversible heat transfer: 1 q2 = 1 T ds; δq = T ds.

Figure 1.1 gives an example of an isothermal thermodynamic process going from state 1
to state 2 in various thermodynamic planes. Figure 1.2 gives a sketch of a thermodynamic
cycle.
Example 1.1
Consider an ideal gas in the T − s plane. Compare the slope of an isochore to that of an isobar at
a given point.
Recall the Gibbs equation for a simple compressible substance:
T ds = du + P dv.

(1.1)

We have for the ideal gas
du = cv dT,

if ideal gas.

(1.2)

This holds for all ideal gases, be they calorically perfect or imperfect. Thus, the Gibbs equation can be
rewritten as
T ds = cv dT +P dv.

For an ideal gas, dh = cP dT , where cP is at most a function of T , so

Now for the isobar, dP = 0. Thus on an isobar, we have
T ds = cP dT,

on an isobar.

And so the slope on an isobar in the T − s plane is

(1.12)

Since cP > cv , (recall for an ideal gas that cP (T ) − cv (T ) = R > 0), we can say that the slope of the
isochore is steeper than the isobar in the T − s plane.

Example 1.2
Consider the following isobaric process for air, modeled as a CPIG, from state 1 to state 2. P1 =
100 kP a, T1 = 300 K, T2 = 400 K. Show the second law is satisfied.
Since the process is isobaric, P = 100 kP a describes a straight line in the P − v and P − T planes
and P2 = P1 = 100 kP a. Since we have an ideal gas, we have for the v − T plane:

2.1

Carnot

The Carnot cycle is the most well-known thermodynamic cycle. It is a useful idealization,
but is very difficult to realize in practice. Its real value lies in serving as a standard to which
other cycles can be compared. These are usually fully covered in introductory courses. The
cycle can be considered as follows
• 1 → 2: isentropic compression,
• 2 → 3: isothermal expansion,
• 3 → 4: isentropic expansion, and
• 4 → 1: isothermal compression.
This forms a rectangle in the T − s plane The P − v plane is more complicated. Both
are shown in Figure 2.1. For this discussion, consider a calorically perfect ideal gas. The
isotherms are then straightforward and are hyperbolas described by
1
P = RT .
v
The slope of the isotherms in the P − v plane is found by differentiation:

The slope of the isentrope is found in the following way. Consider first the Gibbs equation,
Eq. (1.1):
T ds = du + P dv.

Because the gas is calorically perfect, one has

(2.5)

so the Gibbs equation, Eq. (2.4), becomes

T ds = cv dT + P dv.

Example 2.1

(Adapted from BS, 7.94, p. 274) Consider an ideal gas Carnot cycle with air in a piston cylinder
with a high temperature of 1200 K and a heat rejection at 400 K. During the heat addition, the volume
triples. The gas is at 1.00 m3 /kg before the isentropic compression. Analyze.
Take state 1 to be the state before the compression. Then

Exergy

Here we will introduce the concept of exergy. This concept is widely used in some industrial
design applications; its use in the fundamental physics literature is not extensive, likely
because it is not a thermodynamic property of a material, but also includes mechanical
properties. This system quantity is one measure of how much useful work can be extracted
from a system which is brought into equilibrium with a so-called reference rest state.
First let us imagine that the surroundings are at a reference temperature of To and a
reference pressure of Po . This yields a reference enthalpy of ho and a reference entropy of so .
We also take the surroundings to be at rest with a velocity of v = 0, and a reference height
of zo .
Consider the sketch of Fig. 2.2. Let us consider a steady flow into and out of a control
volume. The conservation of mass equation yields
dmcv
= ṁin − ṁout .
dt
For steady flow conditions, we have d/dt = 0, so we recover
ṁin = ṁout = ṁ.
The first law of thermodynamics for the control volume yields


1
dEcv
= Q̇cv − Ẇcv + ṁin hin + vin · vin + gzin
dt
2



2

(2.77)

(2.78)

(2.79)

We will soon relate Q̇cv /ṁ to qH,Carnot as sketched in Fig. 2.2; this will introduce a sign
convention problem. For now, we will maintain the formal sign convention associated with
Q̇cv connoting heat transfer into the control volume. For steady flow conditions, we get


1
0 = Q̇cv − Ẇcv + ṁ hin − hout + (vin · vin − vout · vout ) + g(zin − zout ) .

Now take the “in” state to be simply a generic state with no subscript, and the “out”



1
0 = Q̇cv − Ẇcv + ṁ h − ho + (v · v) + g(z − zo ) .
2

(2.81)

Let us next scale by ṁ so as to get
1
0 = qcv − wcv + h − ho + v · v + g(z − zo ).
2
Here we have taken qcv ≡ Q̇cv /ṁ and wcv = Ẇcv /ṁ.
Now, let us insist that wcv = 0, and solve for qcv to get


1
qcv = − h − ho + v · v + g(z − zo ) .
2

(2.82)

(2.83)

Now, we imagine the working fluid to be at an elevated enthalpy, velocity, and height
relative to its rest state. Thus in the process of bringing it to its rest state, we will induce
qcv < 0. By our standard sign convention, this means that thermal energy is leaving the
system. This energy which leaves the system can be harnessed, in the best of all possible
worlds, by a Carnot engine in contact with a thermal reservoir at temperature To to generate
useful work. It is this work which represents the available energy, also known as the exergy.
For the Carnot engine, we have
wCarnot = qH,Carnot − qL,Carnot .

(2.84)

CC BY-NC-ND. 03 August 2012, J. M. Powers.

26

CHAPTER 2. CYCLE ANALYSIS

Note the standard sign convention for work and heat transfer is abandoned for the Carnot
analysis! It is wCarnot which gives the availability or exergy, which we define as ψ:
ψ = qH,Carnot − qL,Carnot .

(2.85)

Now let us require that the heat input to the Carnot engine be the heat associated with the
heat transfer from the control volume. Because of the inconsistency in sign conventions, this
requires that
qcv = −qH,Carnot .

(2.86)

Now for Carnot cycles, we know that
qH,Carnot = T (s − so ),
qL,Carnot = To (s − so ).

(2.87)
(2.88)

So, by substituting Eqs. (2.86) and (2.88) into Eq. (2.85), the availability ψ is
ψ = −qcv − To (s − so ).
Now use Eq. (2.83) to eliminate qcv from Eq. (2.89) to get


1
ψ =
h − ho + v · v + g(z − zo ) − To (s − so ),
2


1
ψ = h − To s + v · v + gz − (ho − To so + gzo) .
2

(2.89)

(2.90)

(2.91)

So the exergy, that is, the ability to useful work, is enhanced by
• high enthalpy h, which for ideal gases implies high temperature T ,
• high velocity v,
• high height z, and
• low entropy (or high order or structure) s.

For T ∼ To P ∼ Po , we can use Taylor series to simplify this somewhat. First, we recall the general
Taylor series for a log function near unity. Consider
y(x) = ln x,

(2.95)

for x ∼ 1. For a Taylor series near x = 1, we have
y(x) ∼ y(1) +

CHAPTER 2. CYCLE ANALYSIS

Rankine

2.3.1

Classical

The Rankine cycle forms the foundation for the bulk of power generating devices which
utilize steam as a working fluid. The ideal cycle is described by
• 1 → 2: isentropic pumping process in the pump,
• 2 → 3: isobaric heat transfer in the boiler,
• 3 → 4: isentropic expansion in the turbine, and
• 4 → 1: isobaric heat transfer in the condenser.
Note that to increase cycle efficiency one can
• lower the condenser pressure (increases liquid water in turbine),
• superheat the steam, or
• increase the pressure during heat addition.
A schematic for the Rankine cycle and the associated path in the T − s plane is shown
in Figure 2.3.

• rate of heat transfer Q̇in to the fluid in the boiler
• rate of heat transfer Q̇out in the condenser

• mass flow rate of condenser cooling water if the cooling water enters at 15 ◦ C and exits at 35 ◦ C.

Use the steam tables to fix the state. At the turbine inlet, one has P3 = 8.0 M P a, and x3 = 1 (saturated
steam). This gives two properties to fix the state, so that

State 1 is saturated liquid at 0.008 M P a, so x1 = 0, P1 = 0.008 M P a. One then gets h1 = hf =
173.88 kJ/kg, v1 = vf = 0.0010084 m3 /kg.
Now state 2 is fixed by the boiler pressure and s2 = s1 . But this requires use of the sparse
compressed liquid tables. Alternatively, the pump work is easily approximated by assuming an incompressible fluid so that

Now for this problem, we have To = 298.15 K, ho = 104.89 kJ/kg, so = 0.3674 kJ/kg/K. We have
estimated ho and so as the enthalpy and entropy of a saturated liquid at 25 ◦ C = 298.15 K.
So the exergies are as follows. At the pump entrance, we get

2.3. RANKINE

2.3.2

Reheat

In a Rankine cycle with reheat, the steam is extracted from an intermediate stage of the
turbine and reheated in the boiler. It is then expanded through the turbine again to the
condenser pressure. One also avoids liquid in the turbine with this strategy. This generally
results in a gain in cycle efficiency. Geometrically, the behavior on a T − s diagram looks
more like a Carnot cycle. This is often covered in an introductory thermodynamics class, so
no formal example will be given here. A schematic for the Rankine cycle with reheat and
the associated T − s diagram is shown in Figure 2.4.

2.3.3

Regeneration

In a Rankine cycle with regeneration, some steam is extracted from the turbine and used
to pre-heat the liquid which is exiting the pump. This can lead to an increased thermal
efficiency, all else being equal. The analysis is complicated by the need to take care of more
complex mass and energy balances in some components. A schematic for the Rankine cycle
with regeneration and open feedwater heating is shown in Figure 2.5.
Example 2.5
(BS, Ex. 11.4, pp. 438-440) Steam leaves boiler and enters turbine at 4 M P a, 400 ◦ C. After
expansion to 400 kP a, some stream is extracted for heating feedwater in an open feedwater heater.
Pressure in feedwater heater is 400 kP a, and water leaves it at a saturated state at 400 kP a. The rest
of the steam expands through the turbine to 10 kP a. Find the cycle efficiency.
• 1 → 2: compression through Pump P 1,
• 2 & 6 → 3: mixing in open feedwater heater to saturated liquid state,
• 3 → 4: compression through Pump P 2,
• 4 → 5: heating in boiler,

This does represent an increase of efficiency over a comparable Rankine cycle without regeneration,
which happens to be 0.369.

• Turbine: These are typically the largest losses in the system. The turbine efficiency is
defined by
wt

η=
=
.
(2.198)
wts
h3 − h4s
Here h4s and wts are the enthalpy and work the working fluid would have achieved had
the process been isentropic. Note this is for a control volume.

• Pump: Pump losses are usually much smaller in magnitude than those for turbines.
The pump efficiency for a control volume is defined by
η=

h2s − h1
wps
=
.
wp
h2 − h1

(2.199)

• Piping: pressure drops via viscous and turbulent flow effects induce entropy gains
in fluid flowing through pipes. There can also be heat transfer from pipes to the
surroundings and vice versa.
• Condenser: Losses are relatively small here.
Losses will always degrade the overall thermal efficiency of the cycle.

2.3.5

Cogeneration

Often steam is extracted after the boiler for alternative uses. A good example is the Notre
Dame power plant, where steam at high pressure and temperature is siphoned from the
turbines to heat the campus in winter. The analysis for such a system is similar to that for
a system with regeneration.
A schematic for cogeneration cycle is shown in Figure 2.6.

In some cycles, it is common to model the working fluid as a fixed mass. In others, it is
common to model the system as a control volume.

The Brayton cycle is the air standard model for gas turbine engines. It is most commonly
modeled on a control volume basis. It has the following components:

Note that if a Carnot cycle were operating between the same temperature bounds that
ηCarnot = 1 − T1 /T3 would be greater than that for the Brayton cycle.
Relative to the Rankine cycle, the Brayton cycle has a large fraction of compressor work.
So the backwork ratio bwr is larger.
One must also account for deviations from ideality. These effects are summarized in
component efficiencies. The relevant efficiencies here, assuming a control volume approach,
are

compressor is 10. The turbine inlet temperature is 1400 K. Find the thermal efficiency, the back work

2.5.2

Regeneration

One can improve cycle efficiency by regeneration. The hot gas in the turbine is used to
preheat the gas exiting the compressor before it enters the combustion chamber. In this
cycle, one takes
• 1 → 2: compression,
• 2 → x: compression exit gas goes through regenerator (heat exchanger),
CC BY-NC-ND. 03 August 2012, J. M. Powers.

44

CHAPTER 2. CYCLE ANALYSIS
• x → 3: combustion chamber,
• 3 → 4: expansion in turbine, and
• 4 → y: turbine exit gas goes through regenerator (heat exchanger).

For this to work, the gas at the turbine exit must have a higher temperature than the gas
at the compressor exit. If the compression ratio is high, the compressor exit temperature is
high, and there is little benefit to regeneration.

Now consider the inlet temperatures to be known. Then the first law constrains the outlet
temperatures such that

If the heat exchanger were an ideal co-flow heat exchanger, one might expect the outlet
temperatures to be the same, that is, Tx = Ty , and one would have Tx = Ty = (1/2)(T2 + T4 ).
But in fact one can do better. If a counter-flow heat exchanger is used, one could ideally
expect to find
Tx = T4 ,

Note this is the Carnot efficiency moderated by the pressure ratio. As the pressure ratio
rises, the thermal efficiency declines.
The regenerator itself will not be perfect. To achieve the performance postulated here
would require infinite time or an infinite area heat exchanger. As both increase, viscous
losses increase, and so there is a trade-off. One can summarize the behavior of an actual
regenerator by an efficiency defined as

Ericsson Cycle

If one used isothermal compression and expansion, which is slow and impractical, in place
of isentropic processes in the Brayton cycle, one would obtain the Ericsson cycle. Diagrams

• 1 → 2: isothermal compression,
• 2 → 3: isobaric heating in the combustion chamber,
• 3 → 4: isothermal expansion in turbine, and
• 4 → 1: isobaric heat transfer in surroundings.

One also takes the control volume approach.
First consider the work in the isothermal compressor. For the control volume, one recalls
that the work is given by the enthalpy difference, and that dh = T ds + vdP = δqc − δwc ,
with δqc = T ds and δwc = −vdP , so
wc = −

Note that P2 /P1 > 1, so wc < 0; work is done on the fluid in the compressor.
For the turbine, again for the control volume, the key is the enthalpy difference and
dh = T ds + vdP = δqt − δwt , with δqt = T ds and δwt = −vdP . The turbine work would be
wt = −

(2.282)

Note that because P2 /P1 > 1, the turbine work is positive.
In the combustion chamber, one has from the first law
h3 − h2 = qC
cP (T3 − T2 ) = qC .

(2.283)
(2.284)

For the isothermal turbine, one has dh = cP dT = 0 = qt − wt , so qt = wt . The heat
transfer necessary to keep the turbine isothermal is
qt = wt = RT3 ln

correction

This is expressed as a Carnot efficiency modified by a correction which degrades the efficiency.
Note the efficiency is less than that of a Carnot cycle. For high temperature ratios and high
pressure ratios, the efficiency approaches that of a Carnot engine.
Now if one used multiple staged intercooling on the compressors and multiple staged
expansions with reheat on the turbines, one can come closer to the isothermal limit, and
better approximate the Carnot cycle.

2.5.4

Jet propulsion

If one modifies the Brayton cycle so that the turbine work is just sufficient to drive the
compressor and the remaining enthalpy at the turbine exit is utilized in expansion in a
nozzle to generate thrust, one has the framework for jet propulsion. Here the control volume
approach is used. A schematic for a jet engine is shown in Figure 2.11. Diagrams for P − v
and T − s for the jet propulsion Brayton cycle are shown in Figure 2.12. An important
component of jet propulsion analysis is the kinetic energy of the flow. In the entrance region
of the engine, the flow is decelerated, inducing a ram compression effect. For high velocity
applications, this effect provides sufficient compression for the cycle and no compressor or
turbine are needed! However, such a device, known as a ramjet, is not self-starting, and so
is not practical for many applications.

One can outline the ideal jet propulsion cycle as follows:
• 1 → a: deceleration and ram compression in diffuser,
• a → 2: isentropic compression in the compressor,
• 2 → 3: isobaric heating in the combustion chamber,
• 3 → 4: isentropic expansion in turbine,
• 4 → 5: isentropic conversion of thermal energy to kinetic energy in nozzle, and
• 5 → 1: isobaric heat transfer in surroundings.
The goal of the jet propulsion cycle is to produce a thrust force which is necessary to
balance a fluid-induced aerodynamic drag force. When such a balance exists, the system is
in steady state. One can analyze such a system in the reference frame in which the engine
is stationary. In such a frame, Newton’s second law gives

CHAPTER 2. CYCLE ANALYSIS

Solving for the thrust force, neglecting the small differences in pressure, one gets,
F = ṁ (v5 − v1 ) .

(2.294)

The work done by the thrust force is the product of this force and the air speed, v1 . This
gives
|Ẇp | = |F · v1 | = |ṁ(v5 − v1 ) · v1 | .
(2.295)
Now the efficiency of the cycle is a bit different. The net work of the turbine and compressor
is zero. Instead, the propulsive efficiency is defined as
Propulsive Power
|Ẇp |
=
,
Energy Input Rate
|Q̇H |

ηp =

(2.296)

|ṁv1 · (v5 − v1 )|
.
ṁ|(h3 − h2 )|

=

(2.297)

Note the following unusual behavior for flight in an ideal inviscid atmosphere in which
the flow always remains attached. In such a flow D’Alembert’s paradox holds: there is
no aerodynamic drag. Consequently there is no need for thrust generation in steady state
operation. Thrust would only be needed to accelerate to a particular velocity. For such
an engine then the exit velocity would equal the entrance velocity: v5 = v1 and F = 0.
Moreover, the propulsive efficiency is ηp = 0.
Example 2.8

(adopted from Çengal and Boles, p. 485). A turbojet flies with a velocity of 850 fst at an altitude
where the air is at 5 psia and −40 F . The compressor has a pressure ratio of 10, and the temperature
at the turbine inlet is 2000 F . Air enters the compressor at a rate of ṁ = 100 lbm
s . Assuming an air
standard with CPIG air, find the

• temperature and pressure at the turbine exit,
• velocity of gas at nozzle exit, and
• propulsive efficiency.

It is usually sufficient to neglect the kinetic energy of the fluid inside the engine. While it still has
a non-zero velocity, it has been slowed enough so that enthalpy dominates kinetic energy inside the
engine. So one takes

Other variants of the turbojet engine include the very important turbofan engine in which
a large cowling is added to the engine and a an additional fan in front of the compressor
forces a large fraction of the air to bypass the engine. The turbofan engine is used in most
large passenger jets. Analysis reveals a significant increase in propulsive efficiency as well as
a reduction in jet noise. Other important variants include the turboprop, propfan, ramjet,
scramjet, jet with afterburners, and rocket.

2.6

Reciprocating engine power cycles

Here are some common notions for engines that depend on pistons driving in cylinders. The
piston has a bore diameter B. The piston is connected to the crankshaft, and the stroke S
of the piston is twice the radius of the crank, Rcrank :
S = 2Rcrank .

(2.340)

See Figure 2.13 for an illustration of this geometry for a piston-cylinder arrangement in two
configurations. The total displacement for all the cylinders is
Vdispl = Ncyl (Vmax − Vmin ) = Ncyl Acyl S.

(2.341)

Note that

For these engines the volumes are closed in expansion and compression, so the net work is

wnet = P dv = Pmef f (vmax − vmin ).

Here one has defined a mean effective pressure: Pmef f . The net work per cylinder per cycle
is
Wnet = mwnet = Pmef f m(vmax − vmin ) = Pmef f (Vmax − Vmin ).
(2.345)
Now consider the total power developed for all the cylinders. Assume the piston operates at
a frequency of ν cycles/s:
Ẇnet = Ncyl Pmef f (Vmax − Vmin )ν.

Note if the compression ratio increases, the thermal efficiency increases. High compression
ratios introduce detonation in the fuel air mixture. This induces strong pressure waves in
the cylinder and subsequent engine knock. It can cause degradation of piston walls.
Some deviations of actual performance from that of the air-standard Otto cycle are as
follows:

• specific heats actually vary with temperature,
• combustion may be incomplete (induces pollution and lowers fuel efficiency),
• work of inlet and exhaust ignored, and
• losses of heat transfer to engine walls ignored.

Example 2.9
(adopted from Moran and Shapiro, p. 363). The temperature at the beginning of the compression
process of an air-standard Otto cycle with a compression ratio of 8 is 540 ◦ R, the pressure is 1 atm,
and the cylinder volume is 0.02 f t3 . The maximum temperature is 3600 ◦ R. Find
• temperature and pressure at each stage of the process,
• thermal efficiency, and
• Pmef f in atm.

Diesel

The air standard Diesel cycle approximates the behavior of a Diesel engine. It is modeled
as a fixed mass system. Here the compression is done before injection, so there is no danger
of premature ignition due to detonation. No spark plugs are used. Diagrams for P − v and
T − s for the Diesel cycle are shown in Figure 2.15. One can outline the Diesel cycle as
follows:
• 1 → 2: isentropic compression in the compression stroke,
• 2 → 3: isobaric heating in the combustion stroke,
• 3 → 4: isentropic expansion in power stroke, and
• 4 → 1: isochoric rejection of heat to the surroundings.

All else being equal, the Otto cycle will have higher efficiency than the Diesel cycle.
However, the Diesel can operate at higher compression ratios because detonation is not as
serious a problem in the compression ignition engine as it is in the spark ignition.
Example 2.10
(adopted from BS, Ex. 12.8 pp. 501-502). An air standard Diesel cycle has a compression ratio of
20, and the heat transferred to the working fluid has 1800 kJ/kg. Take air to be an ideal gas with
variable specific heat. At the beginning of the compression process, P1 = 0.1 M P a, and T1 = 15 ◦ C.
Find
• Pressure and temperature at each point in the process,
• Thermal efficiency,
• Pmef f , the mean effective pressure.

Here the reference pressure is Pref = 0.1 M P a. Note that this happens to be the inlet state, which
is a coincidence; so at the inlet there is no correction to the entropy for pressure deviation from its
reference value. At the inlet, one has T1 = 15 + 273.15 = 288.15 K. One then gets from interpolating

This then becomes a trial and error search in Table A7.1 for the T2 which satisfies the previous equation. If one guesses T2 ∼ 900 K, one gets soT2 = 8.01581 kJ/kg/K, and the right side evaluates to
0.000857198 kJ/kg/K. Performing a trial and error procedure, one finds the results summarized in

Stirling

Another often-studied air-standard engine is given by the Stirling cycle. This is similar to
the Otto cycle except the adiabatic processes are replaced by isothermal ones. The efficiency
can be shown to be equal to that of a Carnot engine. Stirling engines are difficult to build.
Diagrams for P − v and T − s for the Stirling cycle are shown in Figure 2.16.
One can outline the Stirling cycle as follows:
• 1 → 2: isothermal compression in the compression stroke,
• 2 → 3: isochoric heat transfer in the combustion stroke,
• 3 → 4: expansion in power stroke, and
• 4 → 1: isochoric rejection of heat to the surroundings.

Refrigeration

A simple way to think of a refrigerator is a cyclic heat engine operating in reverse. Rather
than extracting work from heat transfer from a high temperature source and rejecting heat
to a low temperature source, the refrigerator takes a work input to move heat from a low
temperature source to a high temperature source.

2.10.1

Vapor-compression

A common refrigerator is based on a vapor-compression cycle. This is a Rankine cycle in
reverse. While one could employ a turbine to extract some work, it is often impractical.
Instead the high pressure gas is simply irreversibly throttled down to low low pressure.
One can outline the vapor-compression refrigeration cycle as follows:
• 1 → 2: isentropic compression
• 2 → 3: isobaric heat transfer to high temperature reservoir in condenser,
• 3 → 4: adiabatic expansion in throttling valve, and
• 4 → 1: isobaric (and often isothermal) heat transfer to low temperature reservoir in
evaporator.
A schematic for the vapor-compression refrigeration cycle is shown in Figure 2.17. A T − s
diagram for the vapor-compression refrigeration cycle is shown in Figure 2.18.
The efficiency does not make sense for a refrigerator as 0 ≤ η ≤ 1. Instead a coefficient

Example 2.11
(from Moran and Shapiro, p. 442) R − 12 is the working fluid in an ideal vapor-compression
refrigeration cycle that communicates thermally with a cold region at 20 ◦ C and a warm region at
40 ◦ C. Saturated vapor enters the compressor at 20 ◦ C and saturated liquid leaves the condenser at
40 ◦ C. The mass flow rate of the refrigerant is 0.008 kg/s. Find
• compressor power in kW ,
• refrigeration capacity in ton,
• coefficient of performance, and

Now at the end of the condenser (state 3), one has T3 = 40 ◦ C. The condenser is on an isobar, so the
pressure is the saturation pressure at the temperature, which is
P3 = P2 = 9.6065 bar.

So, two properties at the end of the compression are known: pressure and entropy. The allows determination of the enthalpy at the end of compression via the tables:

The units ton is used for power and is common in the refrigeration industry. It is the power required
to freeze one “short ton” of water at 0 ◦ C in 24 hours. It is 12000 Btu/hr, 3.516853 kW , or 4.7162 hp.
A short ton is a U.S ton, which is 2000 lbm. A long ton is British and is 2240 lbm. A metric ton is

Air standard

This is effectively the inverse Brayton cycle. It is used in the liquefaction of air and other
gases. It is also used in aircraft cabin cooling. It has the following components:
• 1 → 2: isentropic compression,
• 2 → 3: isobaric heat transfer to a high temperature environment
• 3 → 4: isentropic expansion through turbine, and
• 4 → 1: isobaric heat exchange with low temperature surroundings.

One is often faced with mixtures of simple compressible substances, and it the thermodynamics of such mixtures upon which attention is now fixed. Here a discussion of some of
the fundamentals of mixture theory will be given. In general, thermodynamics of mixtures
can be a challenging topic about which much remains to be learned. In particular, these
notes will focus on ideal mixtures of ideal gases, for which results are often consistent with
intuition. The chemical engineering literature contains a full discussion of the many nuances
associated with non-ideal mixtures of non-ideal materials.

3.1

Some general issues

Here the notation of BS will be used. There is no effective consensus on notation for mixtures.
That of BS is more unusual than most; however, the ideas are correct, which is critical.
Consider a mixture of N components, each a pure substance, so that the total mass and
total number of moles are
m = m1 + m2 + m3 + · · · + mN =
n = n1 + n2 + n3 + · · · + nN =

as ci :

72

CHAPTER 3. GAS MIXTURES

The mole fraction of component i is defined as yi :
yi ≡

ni

n

mole fraction, dimensionless.

(3.4)

Now the molecular mass of species i is the mass of a mole of species i. It units are typically
g/mole. This is an identical unit to kg/kmole. Molecular mass is sometimes called “molecular weight,” but this is formally incorrect, as it is a mass measure, not a force measure.
Mathematically the definition of Mi corresponds to

Example 3.1
Air is often modeled as a mixture in the following molar ratios:
O2 + 3.76N2.

(3.21)

Find the mole fractions, the mass fractions, and the mean molecular mass of the mixture.
Take O2 to be species 1 and N2 to be species 2. Consider the number of moles of O2 to be
n1 = 1 kmole,

(3.22)

n2 = 3.76 kmole.

(3.23)

and N2 to be
The molecular mass of O2 is M1 = 32 kg/kmole. The molecular mass of N2 is M2 = 28 kg/kmole.
The total number of moles is
n = 1 kmole + 3.76 kmole = 4.76 kmole.
So the mole fractions are

1 kmole
= 0.2101,
4.76 kmole
3.76 kmole
= 0.7899.
y2 =

That is to say y1 + y2 = 0.2101 + 0.7899 = 1. Now for the masses, one has

So one has

Now postulates for mixtures are not as well established as those for pure substances.
The literature has much controversial discussion of the subject. A strong advocate of the
axiomatic approach, C. A. Truesdell, proposed the following “metaphysical principles” for
mixtures, which are worth considering.
1. All properties of the mixture must be mathematical consequences of properties of the
constituents.
2. So as to describe the motion of a constituent, we may in imagination isolate it from the
rest of the mixture, provided we allow properly for the actions of the other constituents
upon it.
3. The motion of the mixture is governed by the same equations as is a single body.
Most important for the present discussion is the first principle. When coupled with fluid
mechanics, the second two take on additional importance. The approach of mixture theory
is to divide and conquer. One typically treats each of the constituents as a single material
and then devises appropriate average or mixture properties from those of the constituents.
The best example of this is air, which is not a single material, but is often treated as
such.

3.2. IDEAL AND NON-IDEAL MIXTURES

3.2

Ideal and non-ideal mixtures

A general extensive property, such as U, for an N-species mixture will be such that
U = U(T, P, n1 , n2 , . . . , nN ).

(3.36)

A partial molar property is a generalization of an intensive property, and is defined such that
it is the partial derivative of an extensive property with respect to number of moles, with T
and P held constant. For internal energy, then the partial molar internal energy is

∂U 
ui ≡
(3.37)
.
∂ni T,P,nj ,i6=j
Pressure and temperature are held constant because those are convenient variables to control
in an experiment. One also has the partial molar volume

∂V 
.
vi =
(3.38)
∂ni T,P,nj ,i6=j
It shall be soon seen that there are other natural ways to think of the volume per mole.
Now in general one would expect to find
ui = ui (T, P, n1 , n2 , . . . , nN ),
vi = vi (T, P, n1, n2 , . . . , nN ).

(3.39)
(3.40)

This is the case for what is known as a non-ideal mixture. An ideal mixture is defined as a
mixture for which the partial molar properties ui and vi are not functions of the composition,
that is
ui = ui (T, P ),
vi = vi (T, P ),

if ideal mixture,
if ideal mixture.

(3.41)
(3.42)

An ideal mixture also has the property that hi = hi (T, P ), while for a non-ideal mixture
hi = hi (T, P, n1 , . . . , nN ). Though not obvious, it will turn out that some properties of an
ideal mixture will depend on composition. For example, the entropy of a constituent of an
ideal mixture will be such that
si = si (T, P, n1, n2 , . . . , nN ).

3.3

(3.43)

Ideal mixtures of ideal gases

The most straightforward mixture to consider is an ideal mixture of ideal gases. Even here,
there are assumptions necessary that remain difficult to verify absolutely.

76

CHAPTER 3. GAS MIXTURES

3.3.1

Dalton model

The most common model for a mixture of ideal gases is the Dalton model. Key assumptions
define this model
• Each constituent shares a common temperature.
• Each constituent occupies the entire volume.
• Each constituent possesses a partial pressure which sums to form the total pressure of
the mixture.
The above characterize a Dalton model for any gas, ideal or non-ideal. One also takes for
convenience
• Each constituent behaves as an ideal gas.
• The mixture behaves as a single ideal gas.
It is more convenient to deal on a molar basis for such a theory. For the Dalton model,
additional useful quantities, the species mass concentration ρi , the mixture mass concentration ρ, the species molar concentration ρi , and the mixture molar concentration ρ, can be
defined. As will be seen, these definitions for concentrations are useful; however, they are not
in common usage. Following BS, the bar notation, ·, will be reserved for properties which
are mole-based rather than mass-based. As mentioned earlier, the notion of a partial molal
property is discussed extensively in the chemical engineering literature and has implications
beyond those considered here. For the Dalton model, in which each component occupies the
same volume, one has
Vi = V.

(3.78)
(3.79)

Contrast this with the earlier adopted definition of molar specific volume
vi =

V
.
ni

(3.80)

So, why is there a difference? The molar specific volume is a simple definition. One takes the
instantaneous volume V , which is shared by all species in the Dalton model, and scales it by the
instantaneous number of moles of species i, and acquires a natural definition of molar specific volume
consistent with the notion of a mass specific volume. On the other hand, the partial molar volume
specifies how the volume changes if the number of moles of species i changes, while holding T and P
and all other species mole numbers constant. One can imagine adding a mole of species i, which would
necessitate a change in V in order to guarantee the P remain fixed.

3.3.1.1

Binary mixtures

Consider now a binary mixture of two components A and B. This is easily extended to a
general mixture of N components. First the total number of moles is the sum of the parts:
n = nA + nB .

(3.81)

CC BY-NC-ND. 03 August 2012, J. M. Powers.

80

CHAPTER 3. GAS MIXTURES

Now, write the ideal gas law for each component:
PA VA = nA RTA ,
PB VB = nB RTB .

(3.82)
(3.83)

But by the assumptions of the Dalton model, VA = VB = V , and TA = TB = T , so
PA V
PB V

= nA RT,
= nB RT.

(3.84)
(3.85)

One also has
P V = nRT.

Solving for n, nA and nB , one finds

Likewise
Now, one also desires rational mixture rules for energy, enthalpy, and entropy. Invoke Truesdell’s principles on a mass basis for internal energy. Then the total internal energy U (with

Here the “o” denotes some reference state. As a superscript, it typically means that the
property is evaluated at a reference pressure. For example, soT,A denotes the portion of the
entropy of component A that is evaluated at the reference pressure Po and is allowed to vary
with temperature T . Note also that sA = sA (T, P, yA) and sB = sB (T, P, yB ), so the entropy
of a single constituent depends on the composition of the mixture and not just on T and P .
This contrasts with energy and enthalpy for which uA = uA (T ), uB = uB (T ), hA = hA (T ),
hB = hB (T ) if the mixture is composed of ideal gases. Occasionally, one finds hoA and hoB
used as a notation. This denotes that the enthalpy is evaluated at the reference pressure.
However, if the gas is ideal, the enthalpy is not a function of pressure and hA = hoA , hB = hoB .

Entropy of mixing

Example 3.3
Initially calorically perfect ideal gases A and B are segregated within the same large volume by
a thin frictionless, thermally conducting diaphragm. Thus, both are at the same initial pressure and
temperature, P1 and T1 . The total volume is thermally insulated and fixed, so there are no global heat
or work exchanges with the environment. The diaphragm is removed, and A and B are allowed to mix.
Assume A has mass mA and B has mass mB . The gases are allowed to have distinct molecular masses,
MA and MB . Find the final temperature T2 , pressure P2 , and the change in entropy.

Note that there is a fundamental dependency of the mixing entropy on the mole fractions.
Since 0 ≤ yk ≤ 1, the product is guaranteed to be between 0 and 1. The natural logarithm
of such a number is negative, and thus the entropy change for the mixture is guaranteed
positive semi-definite. Note also that for the entropy of mixing, Truesdell’s third principle
is not enforced.
Now if one mole of pure N2 is mixed with one mole of pure O2 , one certainly expects
the resulting homogeneous mixture to have a higher entropy than the two pure components.
But what if one mole of pure N2 is mixed with another mole of pure N2 . Then we would
expect no increase in entropy. However, if we had the unusual ability to distinguish N2
molecules whose origin was from each respective original chamber, then indeed there would
be an entropy of mixing. Increases in entropy thus do correspond to increases in disorder.
3.3.1.3

Mixtures of constant mass fraction

If the mass fractions, and thus the mole fractions, remain constant during a process, the
equations simplify. This is often the case for common non-reacting mixtures. Air at moderate
values of temperature and pressure behaves this way. In this case, all of Truesdell’s principles
can be enforced. For a CPIG, one would have
u2 − u1 = cA cvA (T2 − T1 ) + cB cvB (T2 − T1 ),
= cv (T2 − T1 ).

The extra entropy is not found in the theory for a single material, and in fact is not in the form suggested

Amagat model

The Amagat model is an entirely different paradigm than the Dalton model. It is not used
as often. In the Amagat model,
• all components share a common temperature T ,
• all components share a common pressure P , and
• each component has a different volume.
Consider, for example, a binary mixture of calorically perfect ideal gases, A and B. For
the mixture, one has
P V = nRT,
(3.251)
with
n = nA + nB .

(3.252)

P VA = nA RT,
P VB = nB RT.

Gas-vapor mixtures

Next consider a mixture of ideal gases in which one of the components may undergo a phase
transition to its liquid state. The most important practical example is an air-water mixture.
Assume the following:
• The solid or liquid contains no dissolved gases.
• The gaseous phases are all well modeled as ideal gases.
• When the gas mixture and the condensed phase are at a given total pressure and temperature, the equilibrium between the condensed phase and its vapor is not influenced
by the other component. So for a binary mixture of A and B where A could have both
gas and liquid components PA = Psat . That is the partial pressure of A is equal to its
saturation pressure at the appropriate temperature.

3.4. GAS-VAPOR MIXTURES

Considering an air water vapor mixture, one models the water vapor as an ideal gas and
expresses the total pressure as
P = Pa + Pv .

(3.258)

Here v denotes vapor and a denotes air. A good model for the enthalpy of the water vapor
is to take
hv (T, lowP ) = hg (T ).

Example 3.6
(from Çengal and Boles, p. 670) A 5 m × 5 m × 3 m room contains air at 25 ◦ C and 100 kP a at a
relative humidity of 75%. Find the
• partial pressure of dry air,
• absolute humidity (i.e. humidity ratio),
• masses of dry air and water vapor in the room, and the
• dew point.
The relation between partial and total pressure is
P = Pa + Pv .

(3.273)

Now from the definition of relative humidity,
Pv = φPg .

(3.274)

Here Pg is the saturation pressure at the same temperature, which is 25 ◦ C. At 25 ◦ C, the tables give
Pg |25

= 3.169 kP a.

(3.275)

So

CHAPTER 3. GAS MIXTURES

Example 3.7
(BS, Ex. 13.5, pp. 536-537.) An air-water vapor mixture enters the cooling coils of an air conditioner
unit. The inlet is at P1 = 105 kP a, T1 = 30 ◦ C, φ1 = 0.80. The exit state is P2 = 100 kP a, T2 = 15 ◦ C,
φ2 = 0.95. Liquid water at 15 ◦ C also exits the system. Find the heat transfer per kilogram of dry air.

Here Pg is the saturated vapor pressure at the inlet temperature, T1 = 30 ◦ C. This is Pg1 = 4.246 kP a.

Adiabatic saturation

In an adiabatic saturation process, an air-vapor mixture contacts a body of water in a well
insulated duct. If the initial humidity of the mixture is less than 100%, some water will
evaporate and join the mixture.
If the mixture leaving the duct is saturated, and the process is adiabatic, the exit temperature is the adiabatic saturation temperature. Assume the liquid water entering the system
enters at the exit temperature of the mixture.

Example 3.8
(BS, 13.7E, p. 540). The pressure of the mixture entering and leaving the adiabatic saturater is
14.7 psia, the entering temperature is 84 F , and the temperature leaving is 70 F , which is the adiabatic
saturation temperature. Calculate the humidity ratio and the relative humidity of the air-water vapor
mixture entering.
The exit state 2 is saturated, so
Pv2 = Pg2 .

(3.333)

The tables give Pv2 = Pg2 = 0.363 psia. Thus one can calculate the absolute humidity by its definition:

Wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures

Humidity is often measured with a psychrometer, which has a wet bulb and dry bulb thermometer.
• The dry bulb measures the air temperature.
• The wet bulb measures the temperature of a water soaked thermometer.
• If the two temperatures are equal, the air is saturated. If they are different, some of
the water on the web bulb evaporates, cooling the wet bulb thermometer.
• The evaporative cooling process is commonly modeled (with some error) as an adiabatic
saturation process.
• These temperatures are also influenced by non-thermodynamic issues such as heat and
mass transfer rates, which induce errors in the device.
• Capacitance-based electronic devices are often used as an alternative to the traditional
psychrometer.

4.1

Exact differentials and state functions

In thermodynamics, one is faced with many systems of the form of the well-known Gibbs
equation, Eq. (1.1):
du = T ds − P dv.

(4.1)

This is known to be an exact differential with the consequence that internal energy u is a
function of the state of the system and not the details of any process which led to the state.
As a counter-example, the work,
δw = P dv,

(4.2)

can be shown to be an inexact differential so that the work is indeed a function of the process
involved. Here we use the notation δ to emphasize that this is an inexact differential.

Example 4.1
Show the work is not a state function. If work were a state function, one might expect it to have
the form
w = w(P, v),

provisional assumption, to be tested.

(4.3)

In such a case, one would have the corresponding differential form
δw =

∂v P

∂w 
= 0.
∂P 

(4.5)

Integrating Eq. (4.5), one finds

w = P v + f (P ),

(4.7)

where f (P ) is some function of P to be determined. Differentiating Eq. (4.7) with respect to P , one
gets

(4.10)

Equation (4.10) cannot be: a function of P only cannot be a function of v. So, w cannot be a state
property:
w 6= w(P, v).
(4.11)

Consider now the more general form
ψ1 dx1 + ψ2 dx2 + · · · + ψN dxN =

ψi dxi .

(4.12)

i=1

Here ψi and xi , i = 1, . . . , N, may be thermodynamic variables. This form is known in
mathematics as a Pfaff differential form. As formulated, one takes at this stage
• xi : independent thermodynamic variables, and
• ψi : thermodynamic variables which are functions of xi .
Now, if the differential in Eq. (4.12), when set to a differential dy, can be integrated to form
the function
y = y(x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ),
(4.13)
the differential is said to be exact. In such a case, one has
dy = ψ1 dx1 + ψ2 dx2 + · · · + ψN dxN =

Now, combining Eqs. (4.14) and (4.15) to eliminate dy, one gets

ψ1 dx1 + ψ2 dx2 + · · · + ψN dxN =

∂y 
− ψN dxN .
0=

(4.17)
Since the variables xi , i = 1, . . . , N, are independent, dxi , i = 1, . . . , N, are all independent in Eq. (4.17), and in general non-zero. For equality, one must require that each of the
coefficients be zero, so

ψ1 =

ψN =

∂xN xj ,j6=N

(4.18)

So when dy is exact, one says that each of the ψi and xi are conjugate to each other.
From here on out, for notational ease, the j 6= 1, j 6= 2, . . . , j 6= N will be ignored in
the notation for the partial derivatives. It becomes especially confusing for higher order
derivatives, and is fairly obvious for all derivatives.
If y and all its derivatives are continuous and differentiable, then one has for all i =
1, . . . , N, and k = 1, . . . , N that

CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THERMODYNAMICS

Since by Eq. (4.19) the order of the mixed second partials does not matter, one deduces from
Eq. (4.21) that

This is a necessary and sufficient condition for the exact-ness of Eq. (4.12). It is a generalization of what can be found in most introductory calculus texts for functions of two
variables.
For the Gibbs equation, (4.1), du = −P dv + T ds, one has
y → u,

x1 → v,

x2 → s,

ψ1 → −P

ψ2 → T.

(4.23)

and one expects the natural, or canonical form of
u = u(v, s).

(4.24)

Here, −P is conjugate to v, and T is conjugate to s. Application of the general form of
Eq. (4.22) to the Gibbs equation (4.1) gives then


∂T 
∂P

∂v s

Equation (4.25) is known as a Maxwell relation. Moreover, specialization of Eq. (4.20) to

If the general differential dy =

• The function y can only be determined to within an additive constant. That is, there
is no absolute value of y; physical significance is only ascribed to differences in y. In
fact now, other means, extraneous to this analysis, can be used to provide absolute
values of key thermodynamic variables. This will be important especially for flows
with reaction.

(4.46)

So ds is exact for an ideal gas. In fact, the relation is verified for so many gases, ideal and non-ideal,
that one simply asserts that ds is exact, rendering s to be path-independent and a state variable.

4.2

Two independent variables

Consider a general implicit function linking three variables, x, y, z:
f (x, y, z) = 0.

(4.47)

In x − y − z space, this will represent a surface. If the function can be inverted, it will be
possible to write the explicit forms
x = x(y, z),

y = y(x, z),

z = z(x, y).

4.3. LEGENDRE TRANSFORMATIONS

4.3

Legendre transformations

The Gibbs equation (4.1), du = −P dv + T ds, is the fundamental equation of classical
thermodynamics. It is a canonical form which suggests the most natural set of variables in
which to express internal energy u are s and v:
u = u(v, s).

(4.77)

However, v and s may not be convenient for a particular problem. There may be other
combinations of variables whose canonical form gives a more convenient set of independent
variables for a particular problem. An example is the enthalpy:
h ≡ u + P v.

(4.78)

dh = du + P dv + vdP.

(4.79)

Differentiating the enthalpy gives

Use now Eq. (4.79) to eliminate du in the Gibbs equation to give
dh
| − P dv
{z − vdP} = −P dv + T ds.

(4.80)

=du

So

dh = T ds + vdP.

(4.81)

So the canonical variables for h are s and P . One then expects
h = h(s, P ).

(4.82)

This exercise can be systematized with the Legendre transformation,1 which defines a set
of second order polynomial combinations of variables. Consider again the exact differential
Eq. (4.14):
dy = ψ1 dx1 + ψ2 dx2 + · · · + ψN dxN .

(4.83)

1

Two differentiable functions f and g are said to be Legendre transformations of each other if their first
derivatives are inverse functions of each other: Df = (Dg)−1 . With some effort, not shown here, one can
prove that the Legendre transformations of this section satisfy this general condition.

CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THERMODYNAMICS

For N independent variables xi and N conjugate variables ψi , by definition there are 2N − 1
Legendre transformed variables:
τ1
τ2
..
.
τN
τ1,2
τ1,3
..
.

= τ1 (ψ1 , x2 , x3 , . . . , xN ) = y − ψ1 x1 ,
= τ2 (x1 , ψ2 , x3 , . . . , xN ) = y − ψ2 x2 ,

(4.84)
(4.85)

= τN (x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . , ψN ) = y − ψN xN ,
= τ1,2 (ψ1 , ψ2 , x3 , . . . , xN ) = y − ψ1 x1 − ψ2 x2 ,
= τ1,3 (ψ1 , x2 , ψ3 , . . . , xN ) = y − ψ1 x1 − ψ3 x3 ,

(4.86)
(4.87)
(4.88)

τ1,...,N = τ1,...,N (ψ1 , ψ2 , ψ3 , . . . , ψN ) = y −

N
X

ψi xi .

(4.89)

i=1

Each τ is a new dependent variable. Each τ has the property that when it is known as a
function of its N canonical variables, the remaining N variables from the original expression
(the xi and the conjugate ψi ) can be recovered by differentiation of τ . In general this is not
true for arbitrary transformations.
Example 4.5
Let y = y(x1 , x2 , x3 ). This has the associated differential form
dy = ψ1 dx1 + ψ2 dx2 + ψ3 dx3 .

(4.90)

Choose now a Legendre transformed variable τ1 ≡ z(ψ1 , x2 , x3 ):
z = y − ψ1 x1 .
Then

dx3 .
dz =
∂ψ1 x2 ,x3
∂x2 ψ1 ,x3
∂x3 ψ1 ,x2

(4.92)

Now differentiating Eq. (4.91), one also gets

dz = dy − ψ1 dx1 − x1 dψ1 .

(4.93)

Elimination of dy in Eq. (4.93) by using Eq. (4.90) gives
dz

=

ψ dx + ψ2 dx2 + ψ3 dx3 −ψ1 dx1 − x1 dψ1 ,
|1 1
{z
}

(4.94)

=dy

=

−x1 dψ1 + ψ2 dx2 + ψ3 dx3 .

Thus from Eq. (4.92), one gets

∂z 
,
x1 = −
∂ψ1 x2 ,x3


∂z 
ψ2 =
,
∂x2 ψ1 ,x3


∂z 
ψ3 =
.
∂x3 ψ1 ,x2

(4.95)

(4.96)

So the original expression had three independent variables x1 , x2 , x3 , and three conjugate variables
ψ1 , ψ2 , ψ3 . Definition of the Legendre function z with canonical variables ψ1 , x2 , and x3 allowed
determination of the remaining variables x1 , ψ2 , and ψ3 in terms of the canonical variables.

4.3. LEGENDRE TRANSFORMATIONS

For the Gibbs equation, (4.1), du = −P dv + T ds, one has y = u, two canonical variables,
x1 = v and x2 = s, and two conjugates, ψ1 = −P and ψ2 = T . Thus N = 2, and one can
expect 22 − 1 = 3 Legendre transformations. They are

τ1,2

τ1 = y − ψ1 x1 = h = h(P, s) = u + P v, enthalpy,
(4.97)
τ2 = y − ψ2 x2 = a = a(v, T ) = u − T s, Helmholtz free energy, (4.98)
= y − ψ1 x1 − ψ2 x2 = g = g(P, T ) = u + P v − T s, Gibbs free energy.
(4.99)

It has already been shown for the enthalpy that dh = T ds + vdP , so that the canonical
variables are s and P . One then also has


∂h 
∂h 
dh =
ds +
dP,
(4.100)
∂s P
∂P s

from which one deduces that


∂h 
,
T =
∂s P


∂h 
.
v=
∂P s

(4.101)

From Eq. (4.101), a second Maxwell relation can be deduced by differentiation of the first
with respect to P and the second with respect to s:


∂T 
∂v 
(4.102)
=
.
∂P s
∂s P
The relations for Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies each supply additional useful relations
including two new Maxwell relations. First consider the Helmholtz free energy
a = u − T s,
da = du − T ds − sdT,
= (−P dv + T ds) − T ds − sdT,
= −P dv − sdT.

(4.103)
(4.104)
(4.105)
(4.106)

So the canonical variables for a are v and T . The conjugate variables are −P and −s. Thus


∂a 
∂a 
da =
dv +
dT.
(4.107)

Consequently, u is not a function of v for an ideal gas, so u = u(T ) alone. Since Eq. (4.78),
h = u + P v, for an ideal gas reduces to h = u + RT
h = u(T ) + RT = h(T ).

Van der Waals gas

A van der Waals gas is a common model for a non-ideal gas. It can capture some of the
behavior of a gas as it approaches the vapor dome. Its form is
P (T, v) =

a
RT
− 2,
v−b v

(4.198)

where b accounts for the finite volume of the molecules, and a accounts for intermolecular
forces.

Entropy rises because heat transferred into system.
In order to transfer heat into the system we must have a different thermal reservoir. This one must

CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THERMODYNAMICS

For an ideal gas, Z = 1. For substances with a simple molecular structure, Z can be
tabulated as functions of the so-called reduced pressure Pr and reduced temperature Tr . Tr
and Pr are dimensionless variables found by scaling their dimensional counterparts by the
specific material’s temperature and pressure at the critical point, Tc and Pc :
Tr ≡

T

Tc

Pr ≡

(4.294)

Often charts are available which give predictions of all reduced thermodynamic properties.
These are most useful to capture the non-ideal gas behavior of materials for which tables are
not available.

4.8

Mixtures with variable composition

Consider now mixtures of N species. The focus here will be on extensive properties and
molar properties.
Assume that each species has ni moles, and the the total number of moles
PN
is n = i=1 ni . Now one might expect the extensive energy to be a function of the entropy,
the volume and the number of moles of each species:
U = U(V, S, ni ).

(4.295)

The extensive version of the Gibbs law in which all of the ni are held constant is
dU = −P dV + T dS.
Thus

Equation (4.300) has 2N +1 −1 Legendre functions. Three are in wide usage: the extensive
analog to those earlier found. They are

A = U − T S,
G = U + P V − T S.

(4.306)

A set of non-traditional, but perfectly acceptable additional Legendre functions would be
formed from U − µ1 n1 . Another set would be formed from U + P V − µ2 n2 . There are
many more, but one in particular is sometimes noted in the literature: the so-called grand

Partial molar properties

Homogeneous functions

In mathematics, a homogeneous function f (x1 , . . . , xN ) of order m is one such that
f (λx1 , . . . , λxN ) = λm f (x1 , . . . , xN ).

(4.329)

f (λx1 , . . . , λxN ) = λf (x1 , . . . , xN ).

(4.330)

If m = 1, one has
Thermodynamic variables are examples of homogeneous functions.

4.9.2

Gibbs free energy

Consider an extensive property, such as the Gibbs free energy G. One has the canonical
form
G = G(T, P, n1 , n2 , . . . , nN ).
(4.331)
One would like to show that if each of the mole numbers ni is increased by a common factor,
say λ, with T and P constant, that G increases by the same factor λ:
λG(T, P, n1 , n2 , . . . , nN ) = G(T, P, λn1 , λn2 , . . . , λnN ).

(4.332)

Differentiate both sides of Eq. (4.332) with respect to λ, while holding P , T , and nj constant,
to get

The temperature and pressure dependence of G must lie entirely within µi (T, P, nj ), which
one notes is also allowed to be a function of nj as well. Consequently, one also sees that the
Gibbs free energy per unit mole of species i is the chemical potential of that species:
g i = µi .

Using Eq. (4.338) to eliminate G in Eq. (4.308), one recovers an equation for the energy:

are not constant.

Irreversible entropy production in a closed system

Consider a multicomponent thermodynamic system closed to mass exchanges with its surroundings coming into equilibrium. Allow the system to be exchanging work and heat with
its surroundings. Assume the temperature difference between the system and its surroundings is so small that both can be considered to be at temperature T . If δQ is introduced
into the system, then the surroundings suffer a loss of entropy:
dSsurr = −

δQ
.
T

(4.375)

The system’s entropy S can change via this heat transfer, as well as via other internal
irreversible processes, such as internal chemical reaction. The second law of thermodynamics
requires that the entropy change of the universe be positive semi-definite:
dS + dSsurr ≥ 0.

(4.376)

Eliminating dSsurr , one requires for the system that
dS ≥

δQ

CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THERMODYNAMICS

Consider temporarily the assumption that the work and heat transfer are both reversible.
Thus, the irreversible entropy production must be associated with internal chemical reaction.
Now the first law for the entire system gives
dU = δQ − δW,
= δQ − P dV,
δQ = dU + P dV.

(4.378)
(4.379)
(4.380)

Note because the system is closed, there can be no species entering or exiting, and so there
is no change dU attributable to dni . While within the system the dni may not be 0, the net
contribution to the change in total internal energy is zero. A non-zero dni within the system
simply re-partitions a fixed amount of total energy from one species to another. Substituting
Eq. (4.380) into Eq. (4.377) to eliminate δQ, one gets
dS ≥

Eq. (4.383) involves properties only and need not require assumptions of reversibility for
processes in its derivation. In special cases, it reduces to simpler forms.
For processes which are isentropic and isochoric, the second law expression, Eq. (4.383),
reduces to
dU|S,V ≤ 0.
(4.384)
For processes which are isoenergetic and isochoric, the second law expression, Eq. (4.383),
reduces to
dS|U,V ≥ 0.

Now using Eq. (4.300) to eliminate dS in Eq. (4.385), one can express the second law as

irreversible entropy production

The irreversible entropy production associated with the internal chemical reaction must be
the left side of Eq. (4.387). Often the irreversible entropy production is defined as σ, with

(4.388)

Now, while most standard texts focusing on equilibrium thermodynamics go to great lengths
to avoid the introduction of time, it really belongs in a discussion describing the approach
to equilibrium. One can divide Eq. (4.387) by a positive time increment dt to get

This will hold if a model for dn

is negative semi-definite. One will expect then for dni /dt to be related to the chemical
potentials µi .
Elimination of dU in Eq. (4.383) in favor of dH from dH = dU + P dV + V dP gives

|dH − P dV

dH − V dP − T dS ≤ 0.

Thus, one finds for isobaric, isentropic equilibration that
dH|P,S ≤ 0.

(4.393)

For the Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies, one analogously finds
dA|T,V ≤ 0,
dG|T,P ≤ 0.

(4.394)
(4.395)

The expression of the second law in terms of dG is especially useful as it may be easy in an
experiment to control so that P and T are constant. This is especially true in an isobaric
phase change, in which the temperature is guaranteed to be constant as well.

Equilibrium in a two-component system

A major task of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is to find a functional form for dni /dt
which guarantees satisfaction of the second law, Eq. (4.400) and gives predictions which
agree with experiment. This will be discussed in more detail in the following chapter on
thermochemistry. At this point, some simple examples will be given in which a naı̈ve but
useful functional form for dni /dt is posed which leads at least to predictions of the correct
equilibrium values. A much better model which gives the correct dynamics in the time
domain of the system as it approaches equilibrium will be presented in the chapter on
thermochemistry.

4.11.1

Phase equilibrium

Here, consider two examples describing systems in phase equilibrium.
Example 4.12
Consider an equilibrium two-phase mixture of liquid and vapor H2 O at T = 100 ◦ C, x = 0.5. Use
the steam tables to check if equilibrium properties are satisfied.
In a two-phase gas liquid mixture one can expect the following reaction:
H2 O(l) ⇌ H2 O(g) .

(4.401)

That is one mole of liquid, in the forward phase change, evaporates to form one mole of gas. In the
reverse phase change, one mole of gas condenses to form one mole of liquid.
CC BY-NC-ND. 03 August 2012, J. M. Powers.

137

4.11. EQUILIBRIUM IN A TWO-COMPONENT SYSTEM

Because T is fixed at 100 ◦ C and the material is a two phase mixture, the pressure is also fixed at a
constant. Here there are two phases at saturation; g for gas and l for liquid. Equation (4.399) reduces
to
µl dnl + µg dng ≤ 0.
(4.402)

Now for the pure H2 O if a loss of moles from one phase must be compensated by the addition to
another. So one must have
dnl + dng = 0.
(4.403)
Hence
So Eq. (4.402), using Eq. (4.404) becomes

dng = −dnl .

µl dnl − µg dnl

≤ 0,

dnl (µl − µg ) ≤ 0.

(4.404)

(4.405)
(4.406)

At this stage of the analysis, most texts, grounded in equilibrium thermodynamics, assert that µl = µg ,
ignoring the fact that they could be different but dnl could be zero. That approach will not be taken
here. Instead divide Eq. (4.406) by a positive time increment, dt ≥ 0 to write the second law as
dnl
(µ − µg )
dt l

≤ 0.

(4.407)

One convenient, albeit naı̈ve, way to guarantee second law satisfaction is to let
dnl
= −κ(µl − µg ),
dt

κ ≥ 0,

convenient, but naı̈ve model

(4.408)

Here κ is some positive semi-definite scalar rate constant which dictates the time scale of approach to
equilibrium. Note that Eq. (4.408) is just a hypothesized model. It has no experimental verification; in
fact, other more complex models exist which both agree with experiment and satisfy the second law.
For the purposes of the present argument, however, Eq. (4.408) will suffice. With this assumption, the
second law reduces to
− κ(µl − µg )2 ≤ 0,
κ ≥ 0,
(4.409)
which is always true.
Eq. (4.408) has two important consequences:

• Differences in chemical potential drive changes in the number of moles.

• The number of moles of liquid, nl , increases when the chemical potential of the liquid is less than that
of the gas, µl < µg . That is to say, when the liquid has a lower chemical potential than the gas, the
gas is driven towards the phase with the lower potential. Because such a phase change is isobaric and
isothermal, the Gibbs free energy is the appropriate variable to consider, and one takes µ = g. When
this is so, the Gibbs free energy of the mixture, G = nl µl + ng µg is being driven to a lower value. So
when dG = 0, the system has a minimum G.

• The system is in equilibrium when the chemical potentials of liquid and gas are equal: µl = µg .
The chemical potentials, and hence the molar specific Gibbs free energies must be the same for
each constituent of the binary mixture at the phase equilibrium. That is
gl = gg .

(4.410)

Now since both the liquid and gas have the same molecular mass, one also has the mass specific Gibbs
free energies equal at phase equilibrium:
gl = gg .

The two values are essentially the same; the difference is likely due to table inaccuracies.

Example 4.13
This example is from BS, 16.20, p. 700. A container has liquid water at 20 ◦ C, 100 kP a, in
equilibrium with a mixture of water vapor and dry air, also at 20 ◦ C, 100 kP a. Find the water vapor
pressure and the saturated water vapor pressure.
Now at this temperature, the tables easily show that the pressure of a saturated vapor is Psat =
2.339 kP a . From the previous example, it is known that for the water liquid and vapor in equilibrium,
one has
gliq = gvap .
(4.414)
Now if both the liquid and the vapor were at the saturated state, they would be in phase equilibrium
and that would be the end of the problem. But they have slight deviations from the saturated state.
One can estimate these deviations with the standard formula
dg = −sdT + vdP.

(4.415)

The tables will be used to get values at 20 ◦ C, for which one can take dT = 0. This allows the
approximation of dg ∼ v dP . So for the liquid,
Z
gliq − gf =
v dP ∼ vf (P − Psat ),
(4.416)
gliq

= gf + vf (P − Psat ).

For the vapor, approximated here as an ideal gas, one has

Here, once again, one allows for deviations of the pressure of the vapor from the saturation pressure.
Now at equilibrium, one enforces gliq = gvap , so one has

The pressure is very near the saturation pressure. This justifies assumptions that for such mixtures, one
can take the pressure of the water vapor to be that at saturation if the mixture is in equilibrium. If the
pressure is higher, the pressure of the vapor becomes higher as well. Figure 4.1 shows how the pressure
of the equilibrium vapor pressure varies with total pressure. Clearly, a very high total pressure, on
the order of 1 GP a is needed to induce the vapor pressure to deviate significantly from the saturation
value.

system.

CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THERMODYNAMICS

4.11.2.1

Isothermal, isochoric system

The simplest system to consider is isothermal and isochoric. The isochoric assumption
implies there is no work in coming to equilibrium.
Example 4.14
At high temperatures, collisions between diatomic nitrogen molecules induce the production of
monatomic nitrogen molecules. The chemical reaction can be described by the model
N2 + N2 ⇌ 2N + N2 .

(4.427)

Here one of the N2 molecules behaves as an inert third body. An N2 molecule has to collide with
something, to induce the reaction. Some authors leave out the third body and write instead N2 ⇌ 2N ,
but this does not reflect the true physics as well. The inert third body is especially important when
the time scales of reaction are considered. It plays no role in equilibrium chemistry.
Consider 1 kmole of N2 and 0 kmole of N at a pressure of 100 kP a and a temperature of 6000 K.
Using the ideal gas tables, find the equilibrium concentrations of N and N2 if the equilibration process
is isothermal and isochoric.
The ideal gas law can give the volume.

Initially, the mixture is all N2 , so its partial pressure is the total pressure, and the initial partial pressure
of N is 0.
Now every time an N2 molecule reacts and thus undergo a negative change, 2 N molecules are
created and thus undergo a positive change, so
− dnN2 =

dnN .

(4.432)

This can be parameterized by a reaction progress variable ζ, also called the degree of reaction, defined
such that

(4.438)

4.11. EQUILIBRIUM IN A TWO-COMPONENT SYSTEM

141

One can also eliminate ζ to get nN in terms of nN2 :
nN = 2 ( nN2 |t=0 − nN2 ) .

(4.439)

Now for the reaction, one must have, for second law satisfaction, that

(4.441)
(4.442)

(4.443)

In order to satisfy the second law, one can usefully, but naı̈vely, hypothesize that the non-equilibrium
reaction kinetics are given by
dζ
= −k(−µN2 + 2µN ),
dt

k ≥ 0,

convenient, but naı̈ve model

(4.444)

Note there are other ways to guarantee second law satisfaction. In fact, a more complicated model is
well known to fit data well, and will be studied later. For the present purposes, this naı̈ve model will
suffice. With this assumption, the second law reduces to
− k(−µN2 + 2µN )2 ≤ 0,

k ≥ 0,

(4.445)

which is always true. Obviously, the reaction ceases when dζ/dt = 0, which holds only when
2µN = µN2 .

(4.446)

Away from equilibrium, for the reaction to go forward, one must expect dζ/dt > 0, and then one
must have
− µN2 + 2µN ≤ 0,
2µN ≤ µN2 .

(4.447)
(4.448)

The chemical potentials are the molar specific Gibbs free energies; thus, for the reaction to go forward,
one must have
2gN ≤ g N2 .

This is a quadratic equation for nN2 . It has two roots
nN2 = 0.888154 kmole

physical;

nN2 = 1.12593 kmole,

non-physical

(4.463)

The second root generates more N2 than at the start, and also yields non-physically negative nN =
−0.25186 kmole. So at equilibrium, the physical root is
nN = 2(1 − nN2 ) = 2(1 − 0.888154) = 0.223693 kmole.

(4.464)

The diatomic species is preferred.
Note in the preceding analysis, the term KP was introduced. This is the so-called equilibrium
“constant” which is really a function of temperature. It will be described in more detail later, but one
notes that it is commonly tabulated for some reactions. Its tabular value can be derived from the more
fundamental quantities shown in this example. BS’s Table A.11 gives for this reaction at 6000 K the
value of ln KP = −2.876. Note that KP is fundamentally defined in terms of thermodynamic properties
for a system which may or may not be at chemical equilibrium. Only at chemical equilibrium, can it
can further be related to mole fraction and pressure ratios.

Indeed, the second law is satisfied. Moreover the irreversible entropy production of the chemical reaction
is 19.4181 − 17.5004 = +1.91772 kJ/K.
For the isochoric, isothermal process, it is also appropriate to use Eq. (4.394), dA|T,V ≤ 0, to check
for second law satisfaction. This turns out to give an identical result. Since by Eq. (4.307), A = U −T S,
A2 − A1 = (U2 − T2 S2 ) − (U1 − T1 S1 ). Since the process is isothermal, A2 − A1 = U2 − U1 − T (S2 − S1 ).
For A2 − A1 ≤ 0, one must demand U2 − U1 − T (S2 − S1 ) ≤ 0, or U2 − U1 ≤ T (S2 − S1 ), or
S2 −S1 ≥ (U2 −U1 )/T . Since 1Q2 = U2 −U1 for this isochoric process, one then recovers S2 −S1 ≥ 1Q2 /T.

4.11.2.2

Isothermal, isobaric system

Allowing for isobaric rather than isochoric equilibration introduces small variation in the
analysis.

Example 4.15
Consider the same reaction
N2 + N2 ⇌ 2N + N2 .

(4.491)

for an isobaric and isothermal process. That is, consider 1 kmole of N2 and 0 kmole of N at a pressure
of 100 kP a and a temperature of 6000 K. Using the ideal gas tables, find the equilibrium concentrations
of N and N2 if the equilibration process is isothermal and isobaric.
The initial volume is the same as from the previous example:
V1

= 498.84 m3 .

(4.492)

Note the volume will change in this isobaric process. Initially, the mixture is all N2 , so its partial
pressure is the total pressure, and the initial partial pressure of N is 0.
A few other key results are identical to the previous example:
nN = 2 ( nN2 |t=0 − nN2 ) ,

2gN ≤ g N2 .

The second root generates more N2 than at the start, and also yields non-physically negative nN =

nN = 2(1 − nN2 ) = 2(1 − 0.882147) = 0.235706 kmole.

1Q2

Heat needed to be added to keep the system at the constant temperature. This is because the nitrogen
dissociation process is endothermic. Relative to the isochoric process, more heat had to be added to
maintain the temperature. This to counter the cooling effect of the expansion.
Lastly, it is a straightforward exercise to show that the second law is satisfied for this process.

4.11.3

Equilibrium condition

The results of both of the previous examples, in which a functional form of a progress
variable’s time variation, dζ/dt, was postulated in order to satisfy the second law gave a
condition for equilibrium. This can be generalized so as to require at equilibrium that
N

Here νi represents the net number of moles of species i generated in the forward reaction.

(4.521)

So in the phase equilibrium example, Eq. (4.520) becomes

In the nitrogen chemistry example, Eq. (4.520) becomes
µN2 (−1) + µN (2) = 0.

5.1

Molecular mass

The molecular mass of a molecule is a straightforward notion from chemistry. One simply
sums the product of the number of atoms and each atom’s atomic mass to form the molecular
mass. If one defines L as the number of elements present in species i, φli as the number of
moles of atomic element l in species i, and Ml as the atomic mass of element l, the molecular
mass Mi of species i
L
X
Mi =
Ml φli ,
i = 1, . . . , N.
(5.1)
l=1

In vector form, one would say
MT = MT · φ,

or

M = φT · M.

(5.2)

Here M is the vector of length N containing the molecular masses, M is the vector of length
L containing the elemental masses, and φ is the matrix of dimension L × N containing the
number of moles of each element in each species. Generally, φ is full rank. If N > L, φ has
rank L. If N < L, φ has rank N. In any problem involving an actual chemical reaction, one
will find N ≥ L, and in most cases N > L. In isolated problems not involving a reaction,
one may have N < L. In any case, M lies in the column space of φT , which is the row space
of φ.

CHAPTER 5. THERMOCHEMISTRY OF A SINGLE REACTION

Example 5.1
Find the molecular mass of H2 O. Here, one has two elements H and O, so L = 2, and one species,
so N = 1; thus, in this isolated problem, N < L. Take i = 1 for species H2 O. Take l = 1 for
element H. Take l = 2 for element O. From the periodic table, one gets M1 = 1 kg/kmole for H,
M2 = 16 kg/kmole for O. For element 1, there are 2 atoms, so φ11 = 2. For element 2, there is 1 atom
so φ21 = 1. So the molecular mass of species 1, H2 O is

Example 5.2
Find the molecular masses of the two species C8 H18 and CO2 . Here, for practice, the vector matrix
notation is exercised. In a certain sense this is overkill, but it is useful to be able to understand a
general notation.
One has N = 2 species, and takes i = 1 for C8 H18 and i = 2 for CO2 . One also has L = 3 elements
and takes l = 1 for C, l = 2 for H, and l = 3 for O. Now for each element, one has M1 = 12 kg/kmole,
M2 = 1 kg/kmole, M3 = 16 kg/kmole. The molecular masses are then given by

5.2.1

Stoichiometry
General development

Stoichiometry represents a mass balance on each element in a chemical reaction. For example,
in the simple global reaction
2H2 + O2 ⇌ 2H2 O,
(5.10)
CC BY-NC-ND. 03 August 2012, J. M. Powers.

151

5.2. STOICHIOMETRY

one has 4 H atoms in both the reactant and product sides and 2 O atoms in both the reactant
and product sides. In this section stoichiometry will be systematized.
Consider now a general reaction with N species. This reaction can be represented by
N
X

νi′ χi

⇌

i=1

N
X

νi′′ χi .

(5.11)

i=1

Here χi is the ith chemical species, νi′ is the forward stoichiometric coefficient of the ith
reaction, and νi′′ is the reverse stoichiometric coefficient of the ith reaction. Both νi′ and νi′′
are to be interpreted as pure dimensionless numbers.
In Equation (5.10), one has N = 3 species. One might take χ1 = H2 , χ2 = O2 , and
χ3 = H2 O. The reaction is written in more general form as
(2)χ1 + (1)χ2 + (0)χ3 ⇌ (0)χ1 + (0)χ2 + (2)χ3 ,
(2)H2 + (1)O2 + (0)H2 O ⇌ (0)H2 + (0)O2 + (2)H2 O.

(5.12)
(5.13)

Here, one has
ν1′ = 2,
ν2′ = 1,
ν3′ = 0,

ν1′′ = 0,
ν2′′ = 0,
ν3′′ = 2.

(5.14)
(5.15)
(5.16)

It is common and useful to define another pure dimensionless number, the net stoichiometric coefficients for species i, νi . Here νi represents the net production of number if the
reaction goes forward. It is given by
νi = νi′′ − νi′ .

(5.17)

For the reaction 2H2 + O2 ⇌ 2H2 O, one has
ν1 = ν1′′ − ν1′ = 0 − 2 = −2,
ν2 = ν2′′ − ν2′ = 0 − 1 = −1,
ν3 = ν3′′ − ν3′ = 2 − 0 = 2.

(5.18)
(5.19)
(5.20)

With these definitions, it is possible to summarize a chemical reaction as

νi χi = 0.

In vector notation, one would say
ν T · χ = 0.

(5.22)

(5.23)

For the reaction of this section, one might write the non-traditional form

CC BY-NC-ND. 03 August 2012, J. M. Powers.

152

CHAPTER 5. THERMOCHEMISTRY OF A SINGLE REACTION

It remains to enforce a stoichiometric balance. This is achieved if, for each element, l =
1, . . . , L, one has the following equality:
N
X

φli νi = 0,

l = 1, . . . , L.

(5.24)

i=1

That is to say, for each element, the sum of the product of the net species production and
the number of elements in the species must be zero. In vector notation, this becomes
φ · ν = 0.

(5.25)

One may recall from linear algebra that this demands that ν lie in the right null space of φ.
Example 5.3
Show stoichiometric balance is achieved for −2H2 − O2 + 2H2 O = 0.
Here again, the number of elements L = 2, and one can take l = 1 for H and l = 2 for O. Also
the number of species N = 3, and one takes i = 1 for H2 , i = 2 for O2 , and i = 3 for H2 O. Then for
element 1, H, in species 1, H2 , one has
φ11 = 2, H in H2 .

5.2. STOICHIOMETRY

Again, this amounts to saying the solution vector (ν1 , ν2 , ν3 )T lies in the right null space of the coefficient

(5.38)

(5.39)

which corresponds to the equally valid

In summary, the stoichiometric coefficients are non-unique but partially constrained by mass conservation. Which set is chosen is to some extent arbitrary, and often based on traditional conventions from
chemistry. But others are equally valid.

There is a small issue with units here, which will be seen to be difficult to reconcile.
In practice, it will have little to no importance. In the previous example, one might be
tempted to ascribe units of kmoles to νi . Later, it will be seen that in classical reaction
kinetics, νi is best interpreted as a pure dimensionless number, consistent with the definition
of this section. So in the context of the previous example, one would then take ξ to be
dimensionless as well, which is perfectly acceptable for the example. In later problems, it
will be more useful to give ξ the units of kmoles. Note that multiplication of ξ by any scalar,
e.g. kmole/(6.02 × 1026 ), still yields an acceptable result.
Example 5.4
Balance an equation for hypothesized ethane combustion
ν1′ C2 H6 + ν2′ O2 ⇌ ν3′′ CO2 + ν4′′ H2 O.

(5.40)

One could also say in terms of the net stoichiometric coefficients
ν1 C2 H6 + ν2 O2 + ν3 CO2 + ν4 H2 O = 0.

(5.41)

Here one takes χ1 = C2 H6 , χ2 = O2 , χ3 CO2 , and χ4 = H2 O. So there are N = 4 species. There are

Here, there are three equations in four unknowns, so the system is under-constrained. There are many
ways to address this problem. Here, choose the robust way of casting the system into row echelon form.
This is easily achieved by Gaussian elimination. Row echelon form seeks to have lots of zeros in the
lower left part of the matrix. The lower left corner has a zero already, so that is useful. Now, multiply
the top equation by 3 and subtract the result from the second to get

Consider stoichiometric balance for a propane oxidation reaction which may produce carbon monoxide and hydroxyl in addition to carbon dioxide and water.

The most general reaction that can achieve a stoichiometric balance is given by

(−2ξˆ2 − ξ̂3 )C3 H8 + (4ξˆ1 − 10ξˆ2 − 7ξˆ3 )O2 + (−8ξˆ1 + 6ξˆ2 + 3ξˆ3 )CO2 + 8ξˆ1 CO + 8ξˆ2 H2 O + 8ξˆ3 OH = 0. (5.90)
Rearranging, one gets
(2ξˆ2 + ξˆ3 )C3 H8 + (−4ξˆ1 + 10ξˆ2 + 7ξˆ3 )O2 ⇌ (−8ξˆ1 + 6ξˆ2 + 3ξˆ3 )CO2 + 8ξˆ1 CO + 8ξˆ2 H2 O + 8ξˆ3 OH. (5.91)
This will be balanced for all ξ̂1 , ξ̂2 , and ξˆ3 . The values that are actually achieved in practice depend
on the thermodynamics of the problem. Stoichiometry only provides some limitations.
A slightly more familiar form is found by taking ξˆ2 = 1/2 and rearranging, giving
(1 + ξˆ3 ) C3 H8 + (5 − 4ξˆ1 + 7ξˆ3 ) O2 ⇌ (3 − 8ξˆ1 + 3ξˆ3 ) CO2 + 4 H2 O + 8ξˆ1 CO + 8ξˆ3 OH.

158

CHAPTER 5. THERMOCHEMISTRY OF A SINGLE REACTION
One notes that often the production of CO and OH will be small. If there is no production of CO or
OH, ξˆ1 = ξˆ3 = 0 and one recovers the familiar balance of
C3 H8 + 5 O2 ⇌ 3 CO2 + 4 H2 O.

(5.93)

One also notes that stoichiometry alone admits unusual solutions. For instance, if ξ̂1 = 100, ξ̂2 = 1/2,
and ξˆ3 = 1, one has
2 C3 H8 + 794 CO2 ⇌ 388 O2 + 4 H2 O + 800 CO + 8 OH.

(5.94)

This reaction is certainly admitted by stoichiometry but is not observed in nature. To determine
precisely which of the P
infinitely many possible final states are realized requires a consideration of the
N
equilibrium condition i=1 νi µi = 0.
Looked at in another way, we can think of three independent classes of reactions admitted by the
stoichiometry, one for each of the linearly independent null space vectors. Taking first ξ̂1 = 1/4, ξˆ2 = 0,
ξˆ3 = 0, one gets, after rearrangement
2CO + O2 ⇌ 2CO2 ,

(5.95)

as one class of reaction admitted by stoichiometry. Taking next ξˆ1 = 0, ξ̂2 = 1/2, ξˆ3 = 0, one gets
C3 H8 + 5O2 ⇌ 3CO2 + 4H2 O,

(5.96)

as the second class admitted by stoichiometry. The third class is given by taking ξˆ1 = 0, ξ̂2 = 0, ξˆ3 = 1,
and is
C3 H8 + 7O2 ⇌ 3CO2 + 8OH.
(5.97)
In this example, both ξ and ξˆ are dimensionless.

In general, one can expect to find the stoichiometric coefficients for N species composed
of L elements to be of the following form:
νi =

N
−L
X
k=1

Dik ξk ,

i = 1, . . . , N.

(5.98)

Here Dik is a dimensionless component of a full rank matrix of dimension N × (N − L)
and rank N − L, and ξk is a dimensionless component of a vector of parameters of length
N − L. The matrix whose components are Dik are constructed by populating its columns
with vectors which lie in the right null space of φli . Note that multiplication of ξk by any
constant gives another set of νi , and mass conservation for each element is still satisfied.
For later use, we associate νi with the number of moles ni , and consider a differential
change in the number of moles dni from Eq. (5.98) and arrive at
dni =

−L

Fuel-air mixtures

In combustion with air, one often models air as a simple mixture of diatomic oxygen and
inert diatomic nitrogen:
(O2 + 3.76N2 ).
(5.100)
The air-fuel ratio, A and its reciprocal, the fuel-air ratio, F , can be defined on a mass
and mole basis.

(5.102)

If there is not enough air to burn all the fuel, the mixture is said to be rich. If there is
excess air, the mixture is said to be lean. If there is just enough, the mixture is said to be
stoichiometric. The equivalence ratio, Φ, is defined as the actual fuel-air ratio scaled by the
stoichiometric fuel-air ratio:
Φ≡

(5.103)

The ratio Φ is the same whether F ’s are taken on a mass or mole basis, because the ratio of
molecular masses cancel.
Example 5.6
Calculate the stoichiometry of the combustion of methane with air with an equivalence ratio of
Φ = 0.5. If the pressure is 0.1 M P a, find the dew point of the products.
First calculate the coefficients for stoichiometric combustion:
ν1′ CH4 + ν2′ (O2 + 3.76N2 ) ⇌ ν3′′ CO2 + ν4′′ H2 O + ν5′′ N2 ,

(5.104)

ν1 CH4 + ν2 O2 + ν3 CO2 + ν4 H2 O + (ν5 + 3.76ν2 )N2 = 0.

CHAPTER 5. THERMOCHEMISTRY OF A SINGLE REACTION
Now, one might expect to have one free variable, since one has five unknowns in four equations.
While casting the equation in row echelon form is guaranteed to yield a proper solution, one can often
use intuition to get a solution more rapidly. One certainly expects that CH4 will need to be present
for the reaction to take place. One might also expect to find an answer if there is one mole of CH4 . So
take ν1 = −1. Realize that one could also get a physically valid answer by assuming ν1 to be equal to
any scalar. With ν1 = −1, one gets

(5.112)

If there had been more than one free variable, the four by four matrix would have been singular, and
no unique inverse would have existed.
In any case, the reaction under stoichiometric conditions is
− CH4 − 2O2 + CO2 + 2H2 O + (7.52 + (3.76)(−2))N2

=

0,

CH4 + 2(O2 + 3.76N2) ⇌ CO2 + 2H2 O + 7.52N2.

For the stoichiometric reaction, the fuel-air ratio on a mole basis is

(5.117)

(5.118)

By inspection, one can write the actual reaction equation as
CH4 + 4(O2 + 3.76N2 ) ⇌ CO2 + 2H2 O + 2O2 + 15.04N2.

(5.119)

Check:
Factual =

1

4 + 4(3.76)

(5.120)

For the dew point of the products, one needs the partial pressure of H2 O. The mole fraction of
H2 O is
2
= 0.0499
(5.121)
yH2 O =
1 + 2 + 2 + 15.04
So the partial pressure of H2 O is
PH2 O = yH2 O P = 0.0499(100 kP a) = 4.99 kP a.

(5.122)

From the steam tables, the saturation temperature at this pressure is Tsat = Tdew point = 32.88 ◦ C . If
the products cool to this temperature in an exhaust device, the water could condense in the apparatus.

First law analysis of reacting systems

One can easily use the first law to learn much about chemically reacting systems.

5.3.1

Enthalpy of formation

The enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy that is required to form a molecule from combining
its constituents at P = 0.1 MP a and T = 298 K. Consider the reaction (taken here to be
irreversible)
C + O2 → CO2 .
(5.123)
In order to maintain the process at constant temperature, it is found that heat transfer to
the volume is necessary. For the steady constant pressure process, one has
U2 − U1 =

− 1W2 ,
Z 2
= 1Q2 −
P dV,
1Q2

(5.124)
(5.125)

1Q2

1Q2

= 1Q2 − P (V2 − V1 ),
= U2 − U1 + P (V2 − V1 ),
= H2 − H1 ,
= Hproducts − Hreactants .

(5.126)
(5.127)
(5.128)
(5.129)

So
1Q2 =

X

products

ni hi −

X

ni hi .

(5.130)

reactants

In this reaction, one measures that 1Q2 = −393522 kJ for the reaction of 1 kmole of C
and O2 . That is the reaction liberates such energy to the environment. So measuring the
heat transfer can give a measure of the enthalpy difference between reactants and products.
Assign a value of enthalpy zero to elements in their standard state at the reference state.
Thus, C and O2 both have enthalpies of 0 kJ/kmole at T = 298 K, P = 0.1 MP a. This
enthalpy is designated, for species i,
o

o

hf,i = h298,i ,

(5.131)

and is called the enthalpy of formation. So the energy balance for the products and reactants,
here both at the standard state, becomes

CHAPTER 5. THERMOCHEMISTRY OF A SINGLE REACTION
o

Thus, the enthalpy of formation of CO2 is hf,CO2 = −393522 kJ/kmole, since the reaction
involved creation of 1 kmole of CO2 .
Often values of enthalpy are tabulated in the forms of enthalpy differences ∆hi . These
are defined such that

hi = hf,i + (hi − hf,i ),

=∆hi

(5.135)

Lastly, one notes for an ideal gas that the enthalpy is a function of temperature only,
and so does not depend on the reference pressure; hence
o

o

hi = hi ,

∆hi = ∆hi ,

if ideal gas.

(5.136)

Example 5.7
(BS, Ex. 15.6 pp. 629-630). Consider the heat of reaction of the following irreversible reaction in a
steady state, steady flow process confined to the standard state of P = 0.1 M P a, T = 298 K:
CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2 O(ℓ).

(5.137)

The first law holds that

A more detailed analysis is required in the likely case in which the system is not at the
reference state.
Example 5.8
(adopted from Moran and Shapiro, p. 619) A mixture of 1 kmole of gaseous methane and 2 kmole
of oxygen initially at 298 K and 101.325 kP a burns completely in a closed, rigid, container. Heat
transfer occurs until the final temperature is 900 K. Find the heat transfer and the final pressure.

The combustion is stoichiometric. Assume that no small concentration species are generated. The
global reaction is given by
CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2 O.
(5.142)
The first law analysis for the closed system is slightly different:

Enthalpy and internal energy of combustion

The enthalpy of combustion is the difference between the enthalpy of products and reactants
when complete combustion occurs at a given pressure and temperature. It is also known
CC BY-NC-ND. 03 August 2012, J. M. Powers.

164

CHAPTER 5. THERMOCHEMISTRY OF A SINGLE REACTION

as the heating value or the heat of reaction. The internal energy of combustion is related
and is the difference between the internal energy of products and reactants when complete
combustion occurs at a given volume and temperature.
The term higher heating value refers to the energy of combustion when liquid water is in
the products. Lower heating value refers to the energy of combustion when water vapor is
in the product.

5.3.3

Adiabatic flame temperature in isochoric stoichiometric systems

The adiabatic flame temperature refers to the temperature which is achieved when a fuel and
oxidizer are combined with no loss of work or heat energy. Thus, it must occur in a closed,
insulated, fixed volume. It is generally the highest temperature that one can expect to
achieve in a combustion process. It generally requires an iterative solution. Of all mixtures,
stoichiometric mixtures will yield the highest adiabatic flame temperatures because there is
no need to heat the excess fuel or oxidizer.
Here four examples will be presented to illustrate the following points.
• The adiabatic flame temperature can be well over 5000 K for seemingly ordinary
mixtures.
• Dilution of the mixture with an inert diluent lowers the adiabatic flame temperature.
The same effect would happen in rich and lean mixtures.
• Preheating the mixture, such as one might find in the compression stroke of an engine,
increases the adiabatic flame temperature.
• Consideration of the presence of minor species lowers the adiabatic flame temperature.

The inert diluent significantly lowers the adiabatic flame temperature. This is because the N2 serves as
a heat sink for the energy of reaction. If the mixture were at non-stoichiometric conditions, the excess
species would also serve as a heat sink, and the adiabatic flame temperature would be lower than that
of the stoichiometric mixture.

Example 5.11
Consider a variant on the previous example in which the diluted mixture is preheated to 1000 K.
One can achieve this via an isentropic compression of the cold mixture, such as might occur in an engine.
To simplify the analysis here, the temperature of the mixture will be increased, while the pressure will
be maintained. A closed, fixed, adiabatic volume contains a stoichiometric mixture of 2 kmole of H2 ,
1 kmole of O2 , and 8 kmole of N2 at 100 kP a and 1000 K. Find the adiabatic flame temperature and

Consider a variant on the previous example. Here allow for minor species to be present at equilibrium. A closed, fixed, adiabatic volume contains a stoichiometric mixture of 2 kmole of H2 , 1 kmole
of O2 , and 8 kmole of N2 at 100 kP a and 1000 K. Find the adiabatic flame temperature and the final
pressure, assuming reversible reactions. Here, the details of the analysis are postponed, but the result
is given which is the consequence of a calculation involving detailed reactions rates. One can also solve
an optimization problem to minimize the Gibbs free energy of a wide variety of products to get the
same answer. In this case, the equilibrium temperature and pressure are found to be

Note that the concentrations of the major products went down when the minor species were considered.
The adiabatic flame temperature also went down by a significant amount: 2635 − 2484.8 = 150.2 K.
Some thermal energy was necessary to break the bonds which induce the presence of minor species.

5.4

Chemical equilibrium

Often reactions are not simply unidirectional, as alluded to in the previous example. The
reverse reaction, especially at high temperature, can be important.
Consider the four species reaction
ν1′ χ1 + ν2′ χ2 ⇌ ν3′′ χ3 + ν4′′ χ4 .

(5.216)

In terms of the net stoichiometric coefficients, this becomes
ν1 χ1 + ν2 χ2 + ν3 χ3 + ν4 χ4 = 0.

(5.217)

One can define a variable ζ, the reaction progress. Take the dimension of ζ to be kmoles.
When t = 0, one takes ζ = 0. Now as the reaction goes forward, one takes dζ > 0. And a
forward reaction will decrease the number of moles of χ1 and χ2 while increasing the number
of moles of χ3 and χ4 . This will occur in ratios dictated by the stoichiometric coefficients of
the problem:

gets

irreversible entropy production and thus satisfaction of the second law is to construct the

k ≥ 0,

provisional, naı̈ve assumption

(5.252)

This provisional assumption of convenience will be supplanted later by a form which agrees
well with experiment. Here k is a positive semi-definite scalar. In general, it is a function of
temperature, k = k(T ), so that reactions proceed rapidly at high temperature and slowly at
low temperature. Then certainly the reaction progress variable ζ will cease to change when
the equilibrium condition
N
X
µi νi = 0,
(5.253)

is met. This is equivalent to requiring

α = 0.

(5.254)

Now, while Eq. (5.253) is the most compact form of the equilibrium condition, it is not
the most commonly used form. One can perform the following analysis to obtain the form
in most common usage. Start by equating the chemical potential with the Gibbs free energy
per unit mole for each species i: µi = g i . Then employ the definition of Gibbs free energy
for an ideal gas, and carry out a set of operations:

CHAPTER 5. THERMOCHEMISTRY OF A SINGLE REACTION

the product of the ratio of the partial pressure to the reference pressure raised to the net
stoichiometric coefficients. Also, the net change in Gibbs free energy of the reaction at the
reference pressure, ∆Go , which is a function of T only, has been defined as

The term ∆Go has units of kJ/kmole; it traditionally does not get an overbar. If ∆Go > 0,
one has 0 < KP < 1, and reactants are favored over products. If ∆Go < 0, one gets KP > 1,
and products are favored over reactants. One can also deduce that higher pressures P push
the equilibrium in such a fashion that fewer moles are present, all else being equal. One can
also define ∆Go in terms of the chemical affinity, referred to the reference pressure, as
∆Go = −αo .

(5.269)

One can also define another convenient thermodynamic property, which for an ideal gas
is a function of T alone, the equilibrium constant Kc :

Chemical kinetics of a single isothermal reaction

In the same fashion in ordinary mechanics that an understanding of statics enables an understanding of dynamics, an understanding of chemical equilibrium is necessary to understand
to more challenging topic of chemical kinetics. Chemical kinetics describes the time-evolution
of systems which may have an initial state far from equilibrium; it typically describes the
path of such systems to an equilibrium state. Here gas phase kinetics of ideal gas mixtures
that obey Dalton’s law will be studied. Important topics such as catalysis and solid or liquid
reactions will not be considered.
Further, this section will be restricted to strictly isothermal systems. This simplifies the
analysis greatly. It is straightforward to extend the analysis of this system to non-isothermal
systems. One must then make further appeal to the energy equation to get an equation for
temperature evolution.
The general form for evolution of species is taken to be

≡r

This relation actually holds for isochoric, non-isothermal systems as well, which will not be
considered in any detail here. Here some new variables are defined as follows:
• a: a kinetic rate constant called the collision frequency factor. Its units will depend
on the actual reaction and could involve various combinations of length, time, and
temperature. It is constructed so
that dρi /dt has units of kmole/m3 /s; this requires it
PN
′
to have units of (kmole/m3 )(1− k=1 νk ) /s/K β .
• β: a dimensionless parameter whose value is set by experiments, sometimes combined
with guiding theory, to account for weak temperature dependency of reaction rates.
• E: the activation energy. It has units of kJ/kmole, though others are often used, and is
fit by both experiment and fundamental theory to account for the strong temperature
dependency of reaction.
Note that in Eq. (5.279) that molar concentrations are raised to the νk′ and νk powers. As
it does not make sense to raise a physical quantity to a power with units, one traditionally
interprets the values of νk , νk′ , as well as νk′′ to be dimensionless pure numbers. They are
also interpreted in a standard fashion: the smallest integer values that actually correspond
to the underlying molecular collision which has been modeled. While stoichiometric balance
can be achieved by a variety of νk values, the kinetic rates are linked to one particular set
which is defined by the community.
Equation (5.279) is written in such a way that the species concentration production rate
increases when
• The net number of moles generated in the reaction, measured by νi increases,
• The temperature increases; here, the sensitivity may be very high, as one observes in
nature,
• The species concentrations of species involved in the forward reaction increase; this
embodies the principle that the collision-based reaction rates are enhanced when there
are more molecules to collide,
CC BY-NC-ND. 03 August 2012, J. M. Powers.

5.5. CHEMICAL KINETICS OF A SINGLE ISOTHERMAL REACTION

• The species concentrations of species involved in the reverse reaction decrease.
Here, three intermediate variables which are in common usage have been defined. First one

law of mass action

The reaction rate r has units of kmole/m3 /s.
The temperature-dependency of the reaction rate is embodied in k(T ) is defined by what
is known as an Arrhenius rate law:


−E
β
.
k(T ) ≡ aT exp
(5.282)
RT
This equation was advocated by van’t Hoff in 1884; in 1889 Arrhenius gave a physical justification. The units of k(T ) actually depend on the reaction. This is a weakness of the
theory,
P
3 (1− N

and precludes a clean non-dimensionalization. The units must be (kmole/m )
In terms of reaction progress, one can also take
r=

1 dζ
.
V dt

(5.283)

The factor of 1/V is necessary because r has units of molar concentration per time and ζ
has units of kmoles. The over-riding importance of the temperature sensitivity is illustrated
as part of the next example. The remainder of the expression involving the products of the
species concentrations is the defining characteristic of systems which obey the law of mass
action. Though the history is complex, most attribute the law of mass action to Waage and
Guldberg in 1864.1
Last, the overall molar production rate of species i, is often written as ω̇i , defined as
ω̇i ≡ νi r.

t = 0 s, 1 kmole of N2 exists at P = 100 kP a and T = 6000 K. Take as before the reaction to be
isothermal and isochoric. Consider again the elementary nitrogen dissociation reaction

By inspection of the topology of Fig. 5.2, the only stable root is 0.00178121 kmole
m3 . This root agrees with
the equilibrium value found in an earlier example for the same problem conditions. Small perturbations
from this equilibrium induce the forcing function to supply dynamics which restore the system to its original equilibrium state. Small perturbations from the unstable equilibria induce non-restoring dynamics.
For this root, one can then determine that the stable equilibrium value of ρN = 0.000446882 kmole
m3 .
One can examine this stability more formally. Define an equilibrium concentration ρeq
N2 such that
f (ρeq

(5.328)

This has local asymptotically stable solution

ρN2 = 0.00178121 + C exp (−1209.39t) .

(5.329)

Here C is some integration constant whose value is irrelevant for this analysis. The time scale of
relaxation τ is the time when the argument of the exponential is −1, which is
τ=

= 8.27 × 10−4 s.
1209.39 s−1

(5.330)

One usually finds this time scale to have high sensitivity to temperature, with high temperatures giving
fast time constants and thus fast reactions.
The equilibrium values agree exactly with those found in the earlier example; see Eq. (4.469). Here
the kinetics provide the details of how much time it takes to achieve equilibrium. This is one of the key
questions of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

Isobaric systems

The form of the previous section is the most important as it is easily extended to a Cartesian
grid with fixed volume elements in fluid flow problems. However, there is another important
spatially homogeneous problem in which the formulation needs slight modification: isobaric
reaction, with P equal to a constant. Again, in this section only isothermal conditions will
be considered.
In an isobaric problem, there can be volume change. Consider first the problem of isobaric
expansion of an inert mixture. In such a mixture, the total number of moles of each species
must be constant, so one gets
dni

dt

(5.331)

Now carry out the sequence of operations, realizing the the total mass m is also constant:

So a global density decrease of the inert material due to volume increase of a fixed mass
system induces a concentration decrease of each species. Extended to a material with a

There are two terms dictating the rate change of species molar concentration. The first, a
reaction effect, is precisely the same term that drove the isochoric reaction. The second is
due to the fact that the volume can change if the number of moles change, and this induces
an intrinsic change in concentration. Note that the term ρi RT /P = yi, the mole fraction.
Example 5.14
Study a variant of the nitrogen dissociation problem considered in an earlier example, see p. 145,
in which at t = 0 s, 1 kmole of N2 exists at P = 100 kP a and T = 6000 K. In this case, take the
reaction to be isothermal and isobaric. Consider again the elementary nitrogen dissociation reaction

By inspection of the topology of Fig. 5.2, the only stable, physical root is 0.001583 kmole

perturbations from this equilibrium induce the forcing function to supply dynamics which restore the
system to its original equilibrium state. Small perturbations from the unstable equilibria induce nonrestoring dynamics. For this root, one can then determine that the stable equilibrium value of ρN =

combustion under the otherwise identical conditions.

Some conservation and evolution equations

Here a few useful global conservation and evolution equations are presented for some key
properties. Only some cases are considered, and one could develop more relations for other
scenarios.

5.6.1

Total mass conservation: isochoric reaction

One can easily show that the isochoric reaction rate model, Eq. (5.279), satisfies the principle
of mixture mass conservation. Begin with Eq. (5.279) in a compact form, using the definition
of the reaction rate r, Eq. (5.281) and perform the following operations:

Element mass conservation: isochoric reaction

Through a similar series of operations, one can show that the mass of each element, l =
1, . . . , L, in conserved in this reaction, which is chemical, not nuclear. Once again, begin
with Eq. (5.281) and perform a set of operations,

Here the elemental mole density, ρl e , for element l has been defined. So the element concentration for each element remains constant in a constant volume reaction process:
dρl e
= 0,
dt

l = 1, . . . , L.

(5.406)

One can also multiply by the elemental mass, Ml to get the elemental mass density, ρel :
ρel ≡ Ml ρl e ,

l = 1, . . . , L.

(5.407)

Since Ml is a constant, one can incorporate this definition into Eq. (5.406) to get
dρel
= 0,
dt

l = 1, . . . , L.

(5.408)

The element mass density remains constant in the constant volume reaction. One could also
simply say since the elements’ density is constant, and the mixture is simply a sum of the
elements, that the mixture density is conserved as well.

5.6.3

Energy conservation: adiabatic, isochoric reaction

Consider a simple application of the first law of thermodynamics to reaction kinetics: that
of a closed, adiabatic, isochoric combustion process in a mixture of ideal gases. One may
be interested in the rate of temperature change. First, because the system is closed, there
can be no mass change, and because the system is isochoric, the total volume is a non-zero
constant; hence,

The rate of temperature change is dependent on the absolute energies, not the energy differences. If the reaction is going forward, so r > 0, and that is a direction in which the net
molar energy change is negative, then the temperature will rise.

Energy conservation: adiabatic, isobaric reaction

Solving for the reaction dynamics in an adiabatic isobaric system requires some non-obvious
manipulations. First, the first law of thermodynamics says dU = dQ−dW . Since the process
is adiabatic, one has dQ = 0, so dU + P dV = 0. Since it is isobaric, one gets d(U + P V ) = 0,
or dH = 0. So the total enthalpy is constant. Then

Exothermic reaction, ∆H < 0, and net number increases, ∆n > 0, both tend to decrease the
molar concentrations of the species in the isobaric reaction.
Lastly, the evolution of the adiabatic, isobaric system, can be described by the simultaneous, coupled ordinary differential equations: Eqs. (5.442, 5.450, 5.458). These require
numerical solution in general. Note also that one could also employ a more fundamental
P
treatment as a differential algebraic system involving H = H1 , P = P1 = RT N

Eq. (5.338).

Entropy evolution: Clausius-Duhem relation

Now consider whether the kinetics law that has been posed actually satisfies the second law
of thermodynamics. Consider again Eq. (4.387). There is an algebraic relation on the right
side. If it can be shown that this algebraic relation is positive semi-definite, then the second
law is satisfied, and the algebraic relation is known as a Clausius-Duhem relation.

Obviously, if the forward rate is greater than the reverse rate R′ − R′′ > 0, ln(R′ /R′′ ) > 0,
and the entropy production is positive. If the forward rate is less than the reverse rate,
R′ − R′′ < 0, ln(R′ /R′′ ) < 0, and the entropy production is still positive. The production
rate is zero when R′ = R′′ .
Note that the affinity α can be written as

And so when the forward reaction rate exceeds the reverse, the affinity is positive. It is zero
at equilibrium, when the forward reaction rate equals the reverse.

for isomerization reactions. However, as a pedagogical tool as well as a qualitative model for
real chemistry, it can be valuable.
Consider the reversible reaction
A ⇌ B.
(5.490)
where chemical species A and B have identical molecular masses MA = MB = M. Consider
further the case in which at the initial state, no moles of A only are present. Also take the
reaction to be isochoric and isothermal. These assumptions can easily be relaxed for more
general cases. Specializing then Eq. (5.240) for this case, one has

nA = −ζ + no ,
nB = ζ.

(5.493)

Now no is constant throughout the reaction. Scale by this and define the dimensionless

Now r = (1/V )dζ/dt = (1/V )d(no ζ̂)/dt = (no /V )d(ζ̂)/dt = ρo dζ̂/dt. So the reaction

one notes that all terms are driven to zero for small 1/Kc . Recall that 1 − ζ̂ goes to zero
faster than ln(1− ζ̂) goes to −∞. Note that the entropy inequality is ill-defined for a formally
irreversible reaction with 1/Kc = 0.

Summary of multiple reaction extensions

Consider now the reaction of N species, composed of L elements, in J reactions. This section
will focus on the most common case in which J ≥ (N − L), which is usually the case in large
chemical kinetic systems in use in engineering models. While much of the analysis will only
require J > 0, certain results will depend on J ≥ (N − L). It is not difficult to study the
complementary case where 0 < J < (N − L).

CHAPTER 6. THERMOCHEMISTRY OF MULTIPLE REACTIONS

6.2

Equilibrium conditions

For multicomponent mixtures undergoing multiple reactions, determining the equilibrium
condition is more difficult. There are two primary approaches, both of which are essentially
equivalent. The most straightforward method requires formal minimization of the Gibbs free
energy of the mixture. It can be shown that this actually finds the equilibrium associated
with all possible reactions.

6.2.1

Minimization of G via Lagrange multipliers

Recall
Recall also Eq. (4.397), G = N

one must also demand for a system coming to equilibrium that the element numbers are
conserved. This can be achieved by requiring

N
X
i=1

φli (nio − ni ) = 0,

l = 1, . . . , L.

(6.58)

Here recall nio is the initial number of moles of species i in the mixture, and φli is the number
of moles of element l in species i. If one interprets nio − ni as −νij , the negative of the net
P
mole change, Eq. (6.58) becomes − N
i=1 φli νij = 0, equivalent to Eq. (6.4).

One can now use the method of constrained optimization given by the method of Lagrange
multipliers to extremize G subject to the constraints of element conservation. The extremum
will be a minimum; this will not be proved, but it will be demonstrated. Define a set of L
Lagrange multipliers λl . Next define an augmented Gibbs free energy function G∗ , which is
simply G plus the product of the Lagrange multipliers and the constraints:

G =G+

λl

Now when the constraints are satisfied, one has G∗ = G, so assuming the constraints can be
satisfied, extremizing G is equivalent to extremizing G∗ . To extremize G∗ , take its differential

These non-linear algebraic equations can be solved numerically via a Newton-Raphson technique.
The equations are sensitive to the initial guess, and one can use ones intuition to help guide the
selection. For example, one might expect to have nH2 O somewhere near 2 kmole. Application of the
Newton-Raphson iteration yields

Then solve these considering ni , exp (λO /24942), and exp (λH /24942) as unknowns. The same result
is recovered, but a broader range of initial guesses converge to the correct solution.
One can verify that this choice extremizes G by direct computation; moreover, this will show
that the extremum is actually a minimum. In so doing, one must exercise care to see that element
conservation is retained. As an example, perturb the equilibrium solution above for nH2 and nH such

Leave all other species mole numbers the same. In this way, when ξ = 0, one has the original equilibrium
solution. For ξ 6= 0, the solution
PN moves off the equilibrium value in such a way that elements are
conserved. Then one has G = i=1 µi ni = G(ξ).
The difference G(ξ) − G(0) is plotted in Fig. 6.1. When ξ = 0, there is no deviation from the value
predicted by the Newton-Raphson iteration. Clearly when ξ = 0, G(ξ) − G(0), takes on a minimum
value, and so then does G(ξ). So the procedure works.

Equilibration of all reactions

In another equivalent method, if one commences with a multi-reaction model, one can require
each reaction to be in equilibrium. This leads to a set of algebraic equations for rj = 0, which

With some effort it can be shown that not all of the J equations are linearly independent.
Moreover, they do not possess a unique solution. However, for closed systems, only one of
the solutions is physical, as will be shown in the following section. The others typically
involve non-physical, negative concentrations.
Nevertheless, Eqs. (6.135) are entirely consistent with the predictions of the N + L equations which arise from extremization of Gibbs free energy while enforcing element number
constraints. This can be shown by beginning with Eq. (6.65), rewritten in terms of molar
concentrations, and performing the following sequence of operations:

which is identical to Eq. (6.135), obtained by equilibrating each of the J reactions. Thus,
extremization of Gibbs free energy is consistent with equilibrating each of the J reactions.

6.3

Concise reaction rate law formulations

One can additional analysis to obtain a more efficient representation of the reaction rate law
for multiple reactions. There are two important cases: 1) J ≥ (N − L); this is most common
for large chemical kinetic systems, and 2) J < (N − L); this is common for simple chemistry
models.
The species production rate is given by Eq. (6.14), which reduces to

and

in Eq. (6.154) are redundant.
At this point, it is more convenient to go to a Gibbs vector notation, where there is an
obvious correspondence between the bold vectors and the indicial counterparts:

(6.155)
(6.156)
(6.157)

Because of the L linear dependencies, there is no loss of information in this matrix projection.
This system of N − L equations is the smallest number of differential equations that can be
solved for a general system in which J > (N − L).
Lastly, one recovers the original system when forming

Here, the N × N projection matrix P is symmetric, has norm of unity, has rank of N − L,
has N − L eigenvalues of value unity, and L eigenvalues of value zero. And, while application
of a general projection matrix to ν · r filters some of the information in ν · r, because the
N × (N − L) matrix D spans the same column space as the N × J matrix ν, no information
is lost in Eq. (6.158) relative to the original Eq. (6.155). Mathematically, one can say
P · ν = ν.

6.3.2

Species dominant: J < (N − L)

Next consider the case in which J < (N −L). This often arises in models of simple chemistry,
for example one- or two-step kinetics.
The fundamental reaction dynamics are most concisely governed by the J equations
which form
1 dζ
= r.
V dt

(6.160)

However, r is a function of the concentrations; one must therefore recover ρ as a function
of reaction progress ζ. In vector form, Eq. (6.150) is written as
1
dζ
dρ
= ν· .
dt
V
dt

(6.161)

Take as an initial condition that the reaction progress is zero at t = 0 and that there are an
appropriate set of initial conditions on the species concentrations ρ:
ζ = 0,
ρ = ρo ,

t = 0,
t = 0.

(6.162)
(6.163)

Then, since ν is a constant, Eq. (6.161) is easily integrated. After applying the initial
conditions, Eq. (6.163), one gets
ρ = ρo +

1
ν · ζ.
V

(6.164)

Last, if J = (N − L), either approach yields the same number of equations, and is equally
concise.

6.4

Adiabatic, isochoric kinetics

Here an example which uses multiple reactions for an adiabatic isochoric system is given.
Example 6.4
Consider the full time-dependency of a problem considered in a previous example in which the
equilibrium state was found; see Sec. 5.3.3.4,. A closed, fixed, adiabatic volume contains at t = 0 s a
stoichiometric mixture of 2 kmole of H2 , 1 kmole of O2 , and 8 kmole of N2 at 100 kP a and 1000 K.
Find the reaction dynamics as the system proceeds from its initial state to its final state.
This problem requires a detailed numerical solution. Such a solution was performed by solving
Eq. (6.14) along with the associated calorically imperfect species state equations for a mixture of
eighteen interacting species: H2 , H, O, O2 , OH, H2 O, HO2 , H2 O2 , N , N H2 , N H3 , N2 H, N O, N O2 ,
N2 O, HN O, and N2 . The equilibrium values were reported in a previous example.
The dynamics of the reaction process are reflected in Fig. 6.2. At early time, t < 4 × 10−4 s, the
pressure, temperature, and major reactant species concentrations (H2 , O2 , N2 ) are nearly constant.

CHAPTER 6. THERMOCHEMISTRY OF MULTIPLE REACTIONS
However, the minor species, e.g. OH, N O, HO2 and the major product, H2 O, are undergoing very
rapid growth, albeit concentrations whose value remains small. In this period, the material is in what
is known as the induction period.
After a certain critical mass of minor species has accumulated, exothermic recombination of these
minor species to form the major product H2 O induces the temperature to rise, which accelerates further
the reaction rates. This is manifested in a thermal explosion. A common definition of the end of the
induction period is the induction time, t = tind , the time when dT /dt goes through a maximum. Here
one finds
tind = 4.53 × 10−4 s.
(6.165)
At the end of the induction zone, there is a final relaxation to equilibrium.

Chapter 7
Kinetics in some more detail
Here we give further details of kinetics. These notes are also used to introduce a separate
combustion course and have some overlap with previous chapters.
Let us consider the reaction of N molecular chemical species composed of L elements via
J chemical reactions. Let us assume the gas is an ideal mixture of ideal gases that satisfies
Dalton’s law of partial pressures. The reaction will be considered to be driven by molecular
collisions. We will not model individual collisions, but instead attempt to capture their
collective effect.
An example of a model of such a reaction is listed in Table 7.1. There we find a N = 9
species, J = 37 step irreversible reaction mechanism for an L = 3 hydrogen-oxygen-argon
mixture from Maas and Warnatz,1 with corrected fH2 from Maas and Pope.2 The model has
also been utilized by Fedkiw, et al.3 We need not worry yet about fH2 , which is known as
a collision efficiency factor. The one-sided arrows indicate that each individual reaction is
considered to be irreversible. Note that for nearly each reaction, a separate reverse reaction is
listed; thus, pairs of irreversible reactions can in some sense be considered to model reversible
reactions.
In this model a set of elementary reactions are hypothesized. For the j th reaction we have
the collision frequency factor aj , the temperature-dependency exponent βj and the activation
energy E j . These will be explained in short order. Other common forms exist. Often
reactions systems are described as being composed of reversible reactions. Such reactions are
usually notated by two sided arrows. One such system is reported by Powers and Paolucci4
reported here in Table 7.2. Both overall models are complicated.

CHAPTER 7. KINETICS IN SOME MORE DETAIL

7.1

Isothermal, isochoric kinetics

For simplicity, we will first focus attention on cases in which the temperature T and volume V are both constant. Such assumptions are known as “isothermal” and “isochoric,”
respectively. A nice fundamental treatment of elementary reactions of this type is given by
Vincenti and Kruger in their detailed monograph.5

7.1.1

O − O2 dissociation

One of the simplest physical examples is provided by the dissociation of O2 into its atomic
component O.
7.1.1.1

Pair of irreversible reactions

To get started, let us focus for now only on reactions 13 and 14 from Table 7.1 in the limiting
case in which temperature T and volume V are constant.
7.1.1.1.1 Mathematical model The reactions describe oxygen dissociation and recombination in a pair of irreversible reactions:
13 : O + O + M → O2 + M,
14 : O2 + M → O + O + M,

The irreversibility is indicated by the one-sided arrow. Though they participate in the overall
hydrogen oxidation problem, these two reactions are in fact self-contained as well. So let us
just consider that we have only oxygen in our box with N = 2 species, O2 and O, J = 2
reactions (those being 13 and 14), and L = 1 element, that being O.
Recall that in the cgs system, common in thermochemistry, that 1 erg = 1 dyne cm =
10−7 J = 10−10 kJ. Recall also that the cgs unit of force is the dyne and that 1 dyne =
1 g cm/s2 = 10−5 N. So for cgs we have

molar concentration is given by square brackets, e.g. ρO2 = [O2 ]. The symbol M represents
an arbitrary third body and is an inert participant in the reaction. We also use the common
notation of a temperature-dependent portion of the reaction rate for reaction j, kj (T ), where

In general, we will have ρ be a column vector of dimension N × 1, ν will be a rectangular
matrix of dimension N × J of rank R, and r will be a column vector of length J × 1. So
Eqs. (7.11-7.12) take the form

Note here that the rank R of ν is R = L = 1. Let us also define a stoichiometric matrix φ of
dimension L × N. The component of φ, φli represents the number of element l in species i.
Generally φ will be full rank, which will vary since we can have L < N, L = N, or L > N.
Here we have L < N and φ is of dimension 1 × 2:

φ= 1 2 .
(7.18)
Element conservation is guaranteed by insisting that ν be constructed such that
φ · ν = 0.

(7.19)

So we can say that each of the column vectors of ν lies in the right null space of φ.
For our example, we see that Eq. (7.19) holds:

7.1. ISOTHERMAL, ISOCHORIC KINETICS

Equations (7.24-7.25) with Eqs. (7.22) represent two non-linear ordinary differential equations with initial conditions in two unknowns ρO and ρO2 . We seek the behavior of these two
species concentrations as a function of time.
Systems of non-linear equations are generally difficult to integrate analytically and generally require numerical solution. Before embarking on a numerical solution, we simplify as
much as we can. Note that

dρO
+ 2 O2 = 0,
(7.26)


d
(7.27)

We can integrate and apply the initial conditions (7.22) to get
ρO + 2ρO2 = b
ρO + 2b
ρO2 = constant.

(7.28)

The fact that this algebraic constraint exists for all time is a consequence of the conservation
of mass of each O element. It can also be thought of as the conservation of number of
O atoms. Such notions always hold for chemical reactions. They do not hold for nuclear
reactions.
Standard linear algebra provides a robust way to find the constraint of Eq. (7.28). We
can use elementary row operations to cast Eq. (7.16) into a row-echelon form. Here our goal
is to get a linear combination which on the right side has an upper triangular form. To
achieve this add twice the second equation with the first to form a new equation to replace
the second equation. This gives

Obviously the second equation is one we obtained earlier, d/dt(ρO + 2ρO2 ) = 0, and this
induces our algebraic constraint. We also note the system can be recast as

Here L and L−1 are N × N lower triangular matrices of full rank N, and thus invertible.
The matrix U is upper triangular of dimension N × J and with the same rank as ν, R ≥ L.
The matrix P is a permutation matrix of dimension N × N. It is never singular and thus
always invertable. It is used to effect possible row exchanges to achieve the desired form;
often row exchanges are not necessary, in which case P = I, the N × N identity matrix.

CHAPTER 7. KINETICS IN SOME MORE DETAIL

What we have done is the standard linear algebra decomposition of ν = P−1 · L · U.
We can also decompose the algebraic constraint, Eq. (7.28), in a non-obvious way that
is more readily useful for larger systems. We can write

1
(7.33)
ρO2 = b
ρO2 −

(7.34)

This gives the dependent variables in terms of a smaller number of transformed dependent
variables in a way which satisfies the linear constraints. In vector form, the equation becomes
b + D · ξ.
ρ=ρ

(7.35)

φ · D = 0.

(7.36)

Here D is a full rank matrix which spans the same column space as does ν. Note that ν
may or may not be full rank. Since D spans the same column space as does ν, we must also
have in general

We see here this is true:

(7.37)

We also note that the term exp(−E j /RT ) is a modulating factor to the dynamics. Let
us see how this behaves for high and low temperatures. First for low temperature, we have

• for small T , the modulation is extreme, and the reaction rate is very small,
• for T ∼ E j /R, the reaction rate is extremely sensitive to temperature, and
• for T → ∞, the modulation is unity, and the reaction rate is limited only by molecular
collision frequency.
Now ρO and ρO2 represent molar concentrations which have standard units of mole/cm3 .
So the reaction rates

Here the brackets denote the units of a quantity, and not molar concentration. Let us get
units for the collision frequency factor of reaction 13, a13 . We know the units of the rate
(mole/cm3 /s). Reaction 13 involves three molar species. Since β13 = −1, it also has an
extra temperature dependency. The exponential of a unitless number is unitless, so we need
not worry about that. For units to match, we must have

This discrepancy in the units of aj the molecular collision frequency factor is a burden of traditional chemical kinetics, and causes many difficulties when classical non-dimensionalization
is performed. With much effort, a cleaner theory could be formulated; however, this would
require significant work to re-cast the now-standard aj values for literally thousands of reactions which are well established in the literature.
7.1.1.1.2 Example calculation Let us consider an example problem. Let us take T =
5000 K, and initial conditions b
ρO = 0.001 mole/cm3 and b
ρO2 = 0.001 mole/cm3 . The
initial temperature is very hot, and is near the temperature of the surface of the sun. This
is also realizable in laboratory conditions, but uncommon in most combustion engineering
environments.
We can solve these in a variety of ways. I chose here to solve both Eqs. (7.24-7.25) without
the reduction provided by Eq. (7.28). However, we can check after numerical solution to see
if Eq. (7.28) is actually satisfied. Substituting numerical values for all the constants to get

not commence until t ∼ 10−10 s. This can be shown to be very close to the time between
molecular collisions. For 10−9 s < t < 10−8 s, there is a vigorous reaction. For t > 10−7 s,
the reaction appears to be equilibrated. The calculation gives the equilibrium values ρeO and

as a function of time. If the constraint is exactly satisfied, we will have r = 0. Any non-zero
r will be related to the numerical method we have chosen. It may contain roundoff error
and have a sporadic nature. A plot of r(t) is given in Figure 7.3. Clearly the error is small,
and has the character of a roundoff error. In fact it is possible to drive r to be smaller by
controlling the error tolerance in the numerical method.

7.1.1.1.2.2 Pressure versus time We can use the ideal gas law to calculate the
pressure. Recall that the ideal gas law for molecular species i is
Pi V = ni RT.

(7.57)

Here Pi is the partial pressure of molecular species i, and ni is the number of moles of
molecular species i. Note that we also have
Pi =

So we also have the ideal gas law as
Pi = ρi RT.

(7.60)

Now in the Dalton mixture model, all species share the same T and V . So the mixture
temperature and volume are the same for each species Vi = V , Ti = T . But the mixture
pressure is taken to be the sum of the partial pressures:

This pressure is over 800 atmospheres. It is actually a little too high for good experimental
correlation with the underlying data, but we will neglect that for this exercise.
At the equilibrium state we have more O2 and less O. And we have a different number
of molecules, so we expect the pressure to be different. At equilibrium, the pressure is

7.1.1.1.2.3 Dynamical system form Now Eqs. (7.50-7.51) are of the standard form
for an autonomous dynamical system:
dy
= f(y).
dt

(7.72)

Here y is the vector of state variables (ρO , ρO2 )T . And f is an algebraic function of the state
variables. For the isothermal system, the algebraic function is in fact a polynomial.
Equilibrium
The dynamical system is in equilibrium when
f(y) = 0.

(7.73)

This non-linear set of algebraic equations can be difficult to solve for large systems. For
common chemical kinetics systems, such as the one we are dealing with, there is a guarantee
of a unique equilibrium for which all state variables are physical. There are certainly other
equilibria for which at least one of the state variables is non-physical. Such equilibria can
be quite mathematically complicated.
Solving Eq. (7.73) for our oxygen dissociation problem gives us symbolically from Eq. (7.6CC BY-NC-ND. 03 August 2012, J. M. Powers.

That is, for the net reaction (excluding the inert third body), O2 → O+O, at equilibrium the
product of the concentrations of the products divided by the product of the concentrations
of the reactants is a function of temperature T . And for constant T , this is the so-called
equilibrium constant. This is a famous result from basic chemistry. It is actually not complete
yet, as we have not taken advantage of a connection with thermodynamics. But for now, it
will suffice.
We still have a problem: Eq. (7.78) is still one equation for two unknowns. We solve

that the equilibrium state will be a function of the initial conditions. Mathematically this
is because our system is really best posed as a system of differential-algebraic equations.
Systems which are purely differential equations will have equilibria which are independent
of their initial conditions. Most of the literature of mathematical physics focuses on such
systems of those. One of the foundational complications of chemical dynamics is the the
equilibria is a function of the initial conditions, and this renders many common mathematical
notions from traditional dynamic system theory to be invalid Fortunately, after one accounts
for the linear constraints of element conservation, one can return to classical notions from
traditional dynamic systems theory.
Consider the dynamics of Eq. (7.24) for the evolution of ρO . Equilibrating the right hand
side of this equation, gives Eq. (7.74). Eliminating ρM and then ρO2 in Eq. (7.74) then
substituting in numerical parameters gives the cubic algebraic equation
33948.3 − (1.78439 × 1011 )(ρO )2 − (5.8 × 1013 )(ρO )3 = f (ρO ) = 0.

(7.81)

This equation is cubic because we did not remove the effect of ρM . This will not affect
the equilibrium, but will affect the dynamics. We can get an idea of where the roots are
by plotting f (ρO ) as seen in Figure 7.5. Zero crossings of f (ρO ) in Figure 7.5 represent
equilibria of the system, ρeO , f (ρeO ) = 0. The cubic equation has three roots

Stability of equilibria
CC BY-NC-ND. 03 August 2012, J. M. Powers.

239

7.1. ISOTHERMAL, ISOCHORIC KINETICS

We can get a simple estimate of the stability of the equilibria by considering the slope of
f near f = 0. Our dynamic system is of the form
dρO
= f (ρO ).
dt

(7.85)

• Near the first non-physical root at ρeO = −0.003, a positive perturbation from equilibrium induces f < 0, which induces dρO /dt < 0, so ρO returns to its equilibrium.
Similarly, a negative perturbation from equilibrium induces dρO /dt > 0, so the system
returns to equilibrium. This non-physical equilibrium point is stable. Note stability
does not imply physicality!
• Perform the same exercise for the non-physical root at ρeO = −0.000518944. We find
this root is unstable.
• Perform the same exercise for the physical root at ρeO = 0.000442414. We find this
root is stable.
In general if f crosses zero with a positive slope, the equilibrium is unstable. Otherwise, it
is stable.
Consider a formal Taylor series expansion of Eq. (7.85) in the neighborhood of an equilibrium point ρ3O :

We evaluate df /dρO near the physical equilibrium point at ρO = 0.0004442414 to get

times scales of local evolution is τ where

This nano-second time scale is very fast. It can be shown to be correlated with the mean
time between collisions of molecules.
7.1.1.1.3 Effect of temperature Let us perform four case studies to see the effect of
T on the system’s equilibria and it dynamics near equilibrium.
• T = 3000 K. Here we have significantly reduced the temperature, but it is still higher
than typically found in ordinary combustion engineering environments. Here we find

τ = 1.92059 × 10−7 s.

ρeO = 8.9371 × 10−6

(7.92)
(7.93)

The equilibrium concentration of O dropped by two orders of magnitude relative to
T = 5000 K, and the time scale of the dynamics near equilibrium slowed by two orders
of magnitude.
• T = 1000 K. Here we reduce the temperature more. This temperature is common in
combustion engineering environments. We find
mole
,
cm3
τ = 2.82331 × 101 s.

ρeO = 2.0356 × 10−14

(7.94)
(7.95)

The O concentration at equilibrium is greatly diminished to the point of being difficult
to detect by standard measurement techniques. And the time scale of combustion has
significantly slowed.
• T = 300 K. This is obviously near room temperature. We find
mole

cm3
s.

ρeO = 1.14199 × 10−44
τ = 1.50977 × 1031

(7.96)
(7.97)

The O concentration is effectively zero at room temperature, and the relaxation time
is effectively infinite. As the oldest star in our galaxy has an age of 4.4 × 1017 s, we see
that at this temperature, our mathematical model cannot be experimentally validated,
so it loses its meaning. At such a low temperature, the theory becomes qualitatively
correct, but not quantitatively predictive.

become extremely small, under a nanosecond.
7.1.1.2

Single reversible reaction

The two irreversible reactions studied in the previous section are of a class that is common
in combustion modeling. However, the model suffers a defect in that its link to classical
equilibrium thermodynamics is missing. A better way to model essentially the same physics
and guarantee consistency with classical equilibrium thermodynamics is to model the process
as a single reversible reaction, with a suitably modified reaction rate term.

7.1.2

Zel’dovich mechanism of N O production

Let us consider next a more complicated reaction system: that of NO production known
as the Zel’dovich6 mechanism. This is an important model for the production of a major
pollutant from combustion processes. It is most important for high temperature applications.

7.1.2.1

Mathematical model

The model has several versions. One is
1:
2:

N + NO ⇌ N2 + O,
N + O2 ⇌ NO + O.

(7.147)
(7.148)

similar to our results for O2 dissociation, N2 and O2 are preferred at low temperature. As
the temperature rises N and O begin to appear, and it is possible when they are mixed for
NO to appear as a product.

standard techniques from linear algebra to bring the model equations into a reduced form in
which all of the linear constraints have been explicitly removed.
Let us perform a series of row operations to find all of the linear dependencies. Our aim
is to convert the ν matrix into an upper triangular form. The lower left corner of ν already
has a zero, so there is no need to worry about it. Let us add the first and fourth equations
to eliminate the 1 in the 4, 1 slot. This gives

A way to think of this type of row echelon form is that it defines two free variables, those
associated with the non-zero pivots of U: ρN O and ρN . The remain three variables ρN2 , ρO
and ρO2 are bound variables which can be expressed in terms of the free variables.
The last three of the ordinary differential equations are homogeneous and can be integrated to form
ρN O + ρN + 2ρN2 = C1 ,
ρN + ρO = C2 ,
−ρN O + ρN − 2ρO2 = C3 .

Here the matrix D is of dimension N × R, which here is 5 × 2. It spans the same column

same dimension as ν. In general it will not. If c1 and c2 are the column vectors of D, we

Equations (7.165-7.167) can also be linearly combined in a way which has strong physical relevance. We rewrite the system as three equations in which the first is identical to
Eq. (7.165); the second is the difference of Eqs. (7.166) and (7.167); and the third is half of
Eq. (7.165) minus half of Eq. (7.167) plus Eq. (7.166):

ρN O + ρN + 2ρN2 = C1 ,
(7.176)
ρO + ρN O + 2ρO2 = C2 − C3 ,
(7.177)
1
ρN O + ρN + ρN2 + ρO + ρO2 =
(C1 − C3 ) + C2 .
(7.178)

Equation (7.176) insists that the number of nitrogen elements be constant; Eq. (7.177)
demands the number of oxygen elements be constant; and Eq. (7.178) requires the number
of moles of molecular species be constant. For general reactions, including the earlier studied
oxygen dissociation problem, the number of moles of molecular species will not be constant.
Here because each reaction considered has two molecules reacting to form two molecules,
we are guaranteed the number of moles will be constant. Hence, we get an additional
linear constraint beyond the two for element conservation. Note that since our reaction is
isothermal, isochoric and mole-preserving, it will also be isobaric.
7.1.2.1.3

Example calculation Let us consider an isothermal reaction at
T = 6000 K.

(7.179)

The high temperature is useful in generating results which are easily visualized. It insures
that there will be significant concentrations of all molecular species. Let us also take as an
initial condition

however is physical; moreover, it agrees with the equilibrium we found by direct numerical
integration of the full non-linear equations.
We can use local linear analysis in the neighborhood of each equilibria to rigorously

It is the eigenvalues of the Jacobian9 matrix J that give the time scales of evolution of the
concentrations as well as determine the stability of the local equilibrium point. Recall that
we can usually decompose square matrices via the diagonalization
J = S · Λ · S−1 .

(7.218)

Here, S is the matrix whose columns are composed of the right eigenvectors of J, and Λ is
the diagonal matrix whose diagonal is populated by the eigenvalues of J. For some matrices
(typically not those encountered after our removal of linear dependencies), diagonalization
is not possible, and one must resort to the so-called near-diagonal Jordan form. This will
not be relevant to our discussion, but could be easily handled if necessary. We also recall the
eigenvector matrix and eigenvalue matrix are defined by the standard eigenvalue problem
J · S = S · Λ.

(7.219)

We also recall that the components λ of Λ are found by solving the characteristic polynomial
which arises from the equation
det (J − λI) = 0,

(7.220)

where I is the identity matrix. Defining z such that
S · z ≡ ρ − ρe ,

(7.231)

Thus we can conclude that the physical equilibrium is linearly stable. The local time constants near equilibrium are given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the eigenvalues.
These are
τ1 = 1/|λ1| = 3.181 × 10−8 s,
τ2 = 1/|λ2| = 4.691 × 10−7 s.

(7.232)
(7.233)

Evolution on these two time scales is predicted in Fig. 7.8. This in fact a multiscale problem.
One of the major difficulties in the numerical simulation of combustion problems comes in
the effort to capture the effects at all relevant scales. The problem is made more difficult as
the breadth of the scales expands. In this problem, the breadth of scales is not particularly
challenging. Near equilibrium the ratio of the slowest to the fastest time scale, the stiffness
ratio κ, is
κ=

τ1

(7.234)

Many combustion problems can have stiffness ratios over 106 . This is more prevalent at
lower temperatures.
We can do a similar linearization near the initial state, find the local eigenvalues, and
the the local time scales. At the initial state here, we find those local time scales are
τ1 = 2.403 × 10−8 s,
τ2 = 2.123 × 10−8 s.

(7.235)
(7.236)

So initially the stiffness, κ = (2.403 × 10−8 s)/(2.123 × 10−8 s) = 1.13 is much less, but the
time scale itself is small. It is seen from Fig. 7.8 that this initial time scale of 10−8 s well

predicts where significant evolution of species concentrations commences. For t < 10−8 s, the
model predicts essentially no activity. This can be correlated with the mean time between
molecular collisions–the theory on which estimates of the collision frequency factors aj are
obtained.
We briefly consider the non-physical roots, 1 and 2. A similar eigenvalue analysis of root
1 reveals that the eigenvalues of its local Jacobian matrix are

The eigenvalues are complex with a positive real part. This indicates the root is an unstable
spiral source.
A detailed phase portrait is shown in Fig. 7.9. Here we see all three roots. Their local
character of sink, saddle, or spiral source is clearly displayed. We see that trajectories are
attracted to a curve labeled SIM for “Slow Invariant Manifold.” A part of the SIM is
constructed by the trajectory which originates at root 1 and travels to root 3. The other
part is constructed by connecting an equilibrium point at infinity into root 3. Details are
omitted here.
7.1.2.2

Stiffness, time scales, and numerics

One of the key challenges in computational chemistry is accurately predicting species concentration evolution with time. The problem is made difficult because of the common presence
of physical phenomena which evolve on a widely disparate set of time scales. Systems which
evolve on a wide range of scales are known as stiff, recognizing a motivating example in
mass-spring-damper systems with stiff springs. Here we will examine the effect of temperature and pressure on time scales and stiffness. We shall also look simplistically how different
numerical approximation methods respond to stiffness.
7.1.2.2.1 Effect of temperature Let us see how the same Zel’dovich mechanism behaves at lower temperature, T = 1500 K; all other parameters, including the initial species
concentrations are the same as the previous high temperature example. The pressure however, lowers, and here is P = 6.23550×105 dyne/cm2 , which is close to atmospheric pressure.
For this case, a plot of species concentrations versus time is given in Figure 7.10.

Figure 7.10: ρN O and ρN versus time for Zel’dovich mechanism at T = 1500 K, P =
6.23550 × 105 dyne/cm2 .
At T = 1500 K, we notice some dramatic differences relative to the earlier studied
T = 6000 K. First, we see the reaction commences in around the same time, t ∼ 10−8 s. For
t ∼ 10−6 s, there is a temporary cessation of significant reaction. We notice a long plateau
in which species concentrations do not change over several decades of time. This is actually
a pseudo-equilibrium. Significant reaction recommences for t ∼ 0.1 s. Only around t ∼ 1 s
does the system approach final equilibrium. We can perform an eigenvalue analysis both
at the initial state and at the equilibrium state to estimate the time scales of reaction. For
this dynamical system which is two ordinary differential equations in two unknowns, we will
always find two eigenvalues, and thus two time scales. Let us call them τ1 and τ2 . Both
these scales will evolve with t.
At the initial state, we find
τ1 = 2.37 × 10−8 s,
τ2 = 4.25 × 10−7 s.

(7.241)
(7.242)

The onset of significant reaction is consistent with the prediction given by τ1 at the initial
state. Moreover, initially, the reaction is not very stiff; the stiffness ratio is κ = 17.9.

(7.245)
(7.246)

The slowest time scale near equilibrium is an excellent indicator of how long the system
takes to relax to its final state. Note also that near equilibrium, the stiffness ratio is large,
κ = τ2 /τ1 ∼ 3.8 × 105 . This is known as the stiffness ratio. When it is large, the scales in
the problem are widely disparate and accurate numerical solution becomes challenging.
In summary, we find the effect of lowering temperature while leaving initial concentrations
constant
• lowers the pressure somewhat, slightly slowing down the collision time, and slightly
slowing the fastest time scales, and
• slows the slowest time scales many orders of magnitude, stiffening the system significantly, since collisions may not induce reaction with their lower collision speed.

concentration profiles and show the results of numerical prediction in Figure 7.11 Relative to
the high pressure P = 6.2355 × 105 dyne/cm2 , T = 1500 K case, we notice some similarities
and dramatic differences. The overall shape of the time-profiles of concentration variation
is similar. But, we see the reaction commences at a much later time, t ∼ 10−6 s. For
t ∼ 10−4 s, there is a temporary cessation of significant reaction. We notice a long plateau
in which species concentrations do not change over several decades of time. This is again
actually a pseudo-equilibrium. Significant reaction recommences for t ∼ 10 s. Only around
t ∼ 100 s does the system approach final equilibrium. We can perform an eigenvalue analysis
both at the initial state and at the equilibrium state to estimate the time scales of reaction.
At the initial state, we find
τ1 = 2.37 × 10−6 s,
τ2 = 4.25 × 10−5 s.

By decreasing the initial pressure by a factor of 102 , we decreased the equilibrium concentrations by a factor of 102 and increased the time scales by a factor of 102 , leaving the stiffness

In summary, we find the effect of lowering the initial concentrations significantly while
leaving temperature constant
• lowers the pressure significantly, proportionally slowing down the collision time, as well
as the fastest and slowest time scales, and
• does not affect the stiffness of the system.

7.1. ISOTHERMAL, ISOCHORIC KINETICS

7.1.2.2.3 Stiffness and numerics The issue of how to simulate stiff systems of ordinary
differential equations, such as presented by our Zel’dovich mechanism, is challenging. Here a
brief summary of some of the issues will be presented. The interested reader should consult
the numerical literature for a full discussion. See for example the excellent text of Iserles.10
We have seen throughout this section that there are two time scales at work, and they are
often disparate. The species evolution is generally characterized by an initial fast transient,
followed by a long plateau, then a final relaxation to equilibrium. We noted from the phase
plane of Fig. 7.9 that the final relaxation to equilibrium (shown along the green line labeled
“SIM”) is an attracting manifold for a wide variety of initial conditions. The relaxation onto
the SIM is fast, and the motion on the SIM to equilibrium is relatively slow.
Use of common numerical techniques can often mask or obscure the actual dynamics.
Numerical methods to solve systems of ordinary differential equations can be broadly categorized as explicit or implicit. We give a brief synopsis of each class of method. We cast
each as a method to solve a system of the form
dρ
= f(ρ).
dt

(7.256)

• Explicit: The simplest of these, the forward Euler method, discretizes Eq. (7.256) as
follows:
ρn+1 − ρn
= f(ρn ),
(7.257)
∆t
so that
ρn+1 = ρn + ∆t f(ρn ).

(7.258)

Explicit methods are summarized as
– easy to program, since Eq. (7.258) can be solved explicitly to predict the new
value ρn+1 in terms of the old values at step n.
– need to have ∆t < τf astest in order to remain numerically stable,
– able to capture all physics and all time scales at great computational expense for
stiff problems,
– requiring much computational effort for little payoff in the SIM region of the phase
plane, and thus
– inefficient for some portions of stiff calculations.
• Implicit: The simplest of these methods, the backward Euler method, discretizes
Eq. (7.256) as follows:
ρn+1 − ρn
= f(ρn+1 ),

CHAPTER 7. KINETICS IN SOME MORE DETAIL
so that
ρn+1 = ρn + ∆t f(ρn+1 ).

(7.260)

Implicit methods are summarized as
– more difficult to program since a non-linear set of algebraic equations, Eq. (7.260),
must be solved at every time step with no guarantee of solution,
– requiring potentially significant computational time to advance each time step,
– capable of using very large time steps and remaining numerically stable,
– suspect to missing physics that occur on small time scales τ < ∆t,
– in general better performers than explicit methods.
A wide variety of software tools exist to solve systems of ordinary differential equations.
Most of them use more sophisticated techniques than simple forward and backward Euler
methods. One of the most powerful techniques is the use of error control. Here the user
specifies how far in time to advance and the error that is able to be tolerated. The algorithm,
which is complicated, selects then internal time steps, for either explicit or implicit methods,
to achieve a solution within the error tolerance at the specified output time. A well known
public domain algorithm with error control is provided by lsode.f, which can be found in
the netlib repository.11
Let us exercise the Zel’dovich mechanism under the conditions simulated in Fig. 7.11,
T = 1500 K, P = 6.2355 × 103 dyne/cm2 . Recall in this case the fastest time scale near
equilibrium is τ1 = 7.86 × 10−5 s ∼ 10−4 s at the initial state, and the slowest time scale is
τ = 3.02 × 101 s at the final state. Let us solve for these conditions using dlsode.f, which
uses internal time stepping for error control, in both an explicit and implicit mode. We
specify a variety of values of ∆t and report typical values of number of internal time steps
selected by dlsode.f, and the corresponding effective time step ∆tef f used for the problem,
for both explicit and implicit methods, as reported in Table 7.3.
Obviously if output is requested using ∆t > 10−4 s, the early time dynamics near t ∼
10−4 s will be missed. For physically stable systems, codes such as dlsode.f will still provide
a correct solution at the later times. For physically unstable systems, such as might occur in
turbulent flames, it is not clear that one can use large time steps and expect to have fidelity
to the underlying equations. The reason is the physical instabilities may evolve on the same
time scale as the fine scales which are overlooked by large ∆t.

7.2

Adiabatic, isochoric kinetics

It is more practical to allow for temperature variation within a combustor. The best model
for this is adiabatic kinetics. Here we will restrict our attention to isochoric problems.

Thermal explosion theory

There is a simple description known as thermal explosion theory which provides a good
explanation for how initially slow exothermic reaction induces a sudden temperature rise
accompanied by a final relaxation to equilibrium.
Let us consider a simple isomerization reaction in a closed volume
A ⇌ B.

(7.261)

Let us take A and B to both be calorically perfect ideal gases with identical molecular masses
MA = MB = M and identical specific heats, cvA = cvB = cv ; cP A = cP B = cP . We can
consider A and B to be isomers of an identical molecular species. So we have N = 2 species
reacting in J = 1 reactions. The number of elements L here is irrelevant.

Here U is the total internal energy. Because we insist the problem is adiabatic Q̇ = 0.
Because we insist the problem is isochoric, there is no work done, so Ẇ = 0. Thus we have

Figure 7.12: Dimensionless plot of reaction product concentration λ versus time τ for adiabatic isochoric combustion with simple reversible kinetics.
The right side of Eq. (7.331) is at equilibrium for values of λ which drive it to zero.
Numerical root finding methods show this to occur at λ ∼ 0.920539. Near this root, Taylor
series expansion shows the dynamics are approximated by
d
(λ − 0.920539) = −0.17993(λ − 0.920539) + . . .
dτ

(7.332)

Thus the local behavior near equilibrium is given by
λ = 0.920539 + C exp (−0.17993 τ ) .

(7.333)

Here C is some arbitrary constant. Clearly the equilibrium is stable, with a time constant
of 1/0.17993 = 5.55773.
Numerical solution shows the full behavior of the dimensionless species concentration
λ(τ ); see Figure 7.12. Clearly the product concentration λ is small for some long period of
time. At a critical time near τ = 2.7 × 106 , there is a so-called thermal explosion with a
rapid increase in λ. Note that the estimate of the time constant near equilibrium is orders
of magnitude less than the explosion time, 5.55773 << 2.7 × 106 . Thus, linear analysis
here is a poor tool to estimate an important physical quantity, the ignition time. Once the
ignition period is over, there is a rapid equilibration to the final state. The dimensionless
temperature plot is shown in Figure 7.13. The temperature plot is similar in behavior to
the species concentration plot. At early time, the temperature is cool. At a critical time,
the thermal explosion time, the temperature rapidly rises. This rapid rise, coupled with the
exponential sensitivity of reaction rate to temperature, accelerates the formation of product.
This process continues until the reverse reaction is activated to the extent it prevents further
creation of product.

High activation energy asymptotics

Let us see if we can get an analytic prediction of the thermal explosion time, τ ∼ 2.7 × 106 .
Such a prediction would be valuable to see how long a slowing reacting material might take
to ignite. Our analysis is similar to that given by Buckmaster and Ludford in their Chapter

of λ in the denominator of an exponential term. We need to find a way to move it to the
numerator. Asymptotic methods provide one such way.
Now we recall for early time λ << 1. Let us assume λ takes the form
λ = ǫλ1 + ǫ2 λ2 + ǫ3 λ3 + . . .

(7.335)

Here we will assume 0 < ǫ << 1 and that λ1 (τ ) ∼ O(1), λ2 (τ ) ∼ O(1), . . . , and will define

Detailed H2 − O2 − N2 kinetics

Here is an example which uses multiple reactions for an adiabatic isothermal system is given.
Consider the full time-dependency of a problem similar to the thermal explosion problem
just considered.
A closed, fixed, adiabatic volume, V = 0.3061251 cm3 , contains at t = 0 s a stoichiometric
hydrogen-air mixture of 2 × 10−5 mole of H2 , 1 × 10−5 mole of O2 , and 3.76 × 10−5 mole of
N2 at Po = 2.83230 × 106 P a and To = 1542.7 K.13 Thus the initial molar concentrations
are
ρH2 = 6.533 × 10−5 mole/cm3 ,
ρO2 = 3.267 × 10−5 mole/cm3 ,

ρH2 = 1.228 × 10−4 mole/cm3 .
The initial mass fractions are calculated via ci = Mi ρi /ρ. They are
cH2 = 0.0285,
cO2 = 0.226,
cN2 = 0.745.
To avoid issues associated with numerical roundoff errors at very early time for species
with very small compositions, the minor species were initialized at a small non-zero value
near machine precision; each was assigned a value of 10−15 mole. The minor species all have
ρi = 1.803 × 10−16 mole/cm3 . They have correspondingly small initial mass fractions.
13

We seek the reaction dynamics as the system proceeds from its initial state to its final
state. We use the reversible detailed kinetics mechanism of Table 7.2. This problem requires
a detailed numerical solution. Such a solution was performed by solving the appropriate
equations for a mixture of nine interacting species: H2 , H, O, O2 , OH, H2 O, HO2 , H2 O2 ,
and N2 . The dynamics of the reaction process are reflected in Figs. 7.15-7.17.
At early time, t < 10−7 s, the pressure, temperature, and major reactant species concentrations (H2 , O2 , N2 ) are nearly constant. However, the minor species, e.g. OH, HO2 ,
and the major product, H2 O, are undergoing very rapid growth, albeit with math fractions
whose value remains small. In this period, the material is in what is known as the induction
period.
After a certain critical mass of minor species has accumulated, exothermic recombination
of these minor species to form the major product H2 O induces the temperature to rise, which
accelerates further the reaction rates. This is manifested in a thermal explosion. A common
definition of the end of the induction period is the induction time, t = tind , the time when
dT /dt goes through a maximum. Here one finds
tind = 6.6 × 10−7 s.
