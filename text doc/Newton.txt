NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

Introduction

1 Introduction

1.1 Intended Audience
This book presents a single semester course on Newtonian dynamics that is intended
primarily for upper-division (i.e., junior and senior) undergraduate students majoring in
physics. A thorough understanding of physics at the lower-division level, including a basic
working knowledge of the laws of mechanics, is assumed. It is also taken for granted that
students are familiar with the fundamentals of integral and differential calculus, complex
analysis, ordinary differential equations, and linear algebra. On the other hand, vector
analysis plays such a central role in the study of Newtonian dynamics that a brief, but
fairly comprehensive, review of this subject area is provided in Appendix A. Likewise,
those results in matrix eigenvalue theory which are helpful in the analysis of rigid body
motion and coupled oscillations are discussed in Sections 8.5 and 11.4, respectively. Finally, the calculus of variations, an area of mathematics that is central to Hamiltonian
dynamics, is outlined in Section 10.2.

1.2 Scope of Book
The scope of this book is indicated by its title, “Newtonian Dynamics”. “Dynamics” is
the study of the motions of the various objects in the world around us. Furthermore, by
“Newtonian”, we understand that the theory which we are actually going to employ in our
investigation of dynamics is that which was first formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in 1687.
For the sake of simplicity, and brevity, we shall restrict our investigations to the motions
of idealized point particles and idealized rigid bodies. To be more exact, we shall exclude
from consideration any discussion of statics, the strength of materials, and the non-rigid
motions of continuous media. We shall also concentrate, for the most part, on motions
which take place under the influence of conservative forces, such as gravity, which can be
accurately represented in terms of simple mathematical formulae. Finally, with one major
exception, we shall only consider that subset of dynamical problems that can be solved by
means of conventional mathematical analysis.
Newtonian dynamics was originally developed in order to predict the motions of the
objects which make up the Solar System. It turns out that this is an ideal application of the
theory, since the objects in question can be modeled as being rigid to a fair degree of accuracy, and the motions take place under the action of a single conservative force—namely,
gravity—that has a simple mathematical form. In particular, the frictional forces which
greatly complicate the application of Newtonian dynamics to the motions of everyday objects close to the Earth’s surface are completely absent. Consequently, in this book we shall
make a particular effort to describe how Newtonian dynamics can successfully account for
a wide variety of different solar system phenomena. For example, during the course of this

8

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

book, we shall explain the origins of Kepler’s laws of planetary motion (see Chapter 5),
the rotational flattening of the Earth, the tides, the Roche radius (i.e., the minimum radius
at which a moon can orbit a planet without being destroyed by tidal forces), the forced
precession and nutation of the Earth’s axis of rotation, and the forced perihelion precession of the planets (see Chapter 12). We shall also derive the Tisserand criterion used
to re-identify comets whose orbits have been modified by close encounters with massive
planets, account for the existence of the so-called Trojan asteroids which share the orbit of
Jupiter (see Chapter 13), and analyze the motion of the Moon (see Chapter 14).
Virtually all of the results described in this book were first obtained—either by Newton
himself, or by scientists living in the 150, or so, years immediately following the initial
publication of his theory—by means of conventional mathematical analysis. Indeed, scientists at the beginning of the 20th century generally assumed that they knew everything
that there was to known about Newtonian dynamics. However, they were mistaken. The
advent of fast electronic computers, in the latter half of the 20th century, allowed scientists to solve nonlinear equations of motion, for the first time, via numerical techniques.
In general, such equations are insoluble using standard analytic methods. The numerical investigation of dynamical systems with nonlinear equations of motion revealed the
existence of a previously unknown type of motion known as deterministic chaos. Such
motion is quasi-random (despite being derived from deterministic equations of motion),
aperiodic, and exhibits extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. The discovery of chaotic
motion lead to a renaissance in the study of Newtonian dynamics which started in the late
20th century and is still ongoing. It is therefore appropriate that the last chapter in this
book is devoted to an in-depth numerical investigation of a particular dynamical system
that exhibits chaotic motion (see Chapter 15).

2 Newton’s Laws of Motion

2.1 Introduction
This chapter discusses Newton’s laws of motion.

2.2 Newtonian Dynamics
Newtonian dynamics is a mathematical model whose purpose is to predict the motions of
the various objects that we encounter in the world around us. The general principles of this
model were first enunciated by Sir Isaac Newton in a work entitled Philosophiae Naturalis
Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). This work, which
was first published in 1687, is nowadays more commonly referred to as the Principa.1
Up until the beginning of the 20th century, Newton’s theory of motion was thought
to constitute a complete description of all types of motion occurring in the Universe. We
now know that this is not the case. The modern view is that Newton’s theory is only an
approximation which is valid under certain circumstances. The theory breaks down when
the velocities of the objects under investigation approach the speed of light in vacuum, and
must be modified in accordance with Einstein’s special theory of relativity. The theory also
fails in regions of space which are sufficiently curved that the propositions of Euclidean geometry do not hold to a good approximation, and must be augmented by Einstein’s general
theory of relativity. Finally, the theory breaks down on atomic and subatomic length-scales,
and must be replaced by quantum mechanics. In this book, we shall neglect relativistic and
quantum effects all together. It follows that we must restrict our investigations to the motions of large (compared to an atom) slow (compared to the speed of light) objects moving
in Euclidean space. Fortunately, virtually all of the motions which we commonly observe
in the world around us fall into this category.
Newton very deliberately modeled his approach in the Principia on that taken in Euclid’s
Elements. Indeed, Newton’s theory of motion has much in common with a conventional
axiomatic system such as Euclidean geometry. Like all such systems, Newtonian dynamics
starts from a set of terms that are undefined within the system. In this case, the fundamental terms are mass, position, time, and force. It is taken for granted that we understand
what these terms mean, and, furthermore, that they correspond to measurable quantities
which can be ascribed to, or associated with, objects in the world around us. In particular, it is assumed that the ideas of position in space, distance in space, and position as
a function of time in space, are correctly described by the Euclidean vector algebra and
1

An excellent discussion of the historical development of Newtonian dynamics, as well as the physical
and philosophical assumptions which underpin this theory, is given in The Discovery of Dynamics: A Study
from a Machian Point of View of the Discovery and the Structure of Dynamical Theories, J.B. Barbour (Oxford
University Press, Oxford UK, 2001).

vector calculus discussed in Appendix A. The next component of an axiomatic system is
a set of axioms. These are a set of unproven propositions, involving the undefined terms,
from which all other propositions in the system can be derived via logic and mathematical
analysis. In the present case, the axioms are called Newton’s laws of motion, and can only
be justified via experimental observation. Note, incidentally, that Newton’s laws, in their
primitive form, are only applicable to point objects. However, these laws can be applied to
extended objects by treating them as collections of point objects.
One difference between an axiomatic system and a physical theory is that, in the latter
case, even if a given prediction has been shown to follow necessarily from the axioms of
the theory, it is still incumbent upon us to test the prediction against experimental observations. Lack of agreement might indicate faulty experimental data, faulty application of
the theory (for instance, in the case of Newtonian dynamics, there might be forces at work
which we have not identified), or, as a last resort, incorrectness of the theory. Fortunately,
Newtonian dynamics has been found to give predictions which are in excellent agreement
with experimental observations in all situations in which it is expected to be valid.
In the following, it is assumed that we know how to set up a rigid Cartesian frame of
reference, and how to measure the positions of point objects as functions of time within
that frame. It is also taken for granted that we have some basic familiarity with the laws of
mechanics, and standard mathematics up to, and including, calculus, as well as the vector
analysis outlined in Appendix A.

2.3 Newton’s Laws of Motion
Newton’s laws of motion, in the rather obscure language of the Principia, take the following form:
1. Every body continues in its state of rest, or uniform motion in a straight-line, unless
compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it.
2. The change of motion (i.e., momentum) of an object is proportional to the force
impressed upon it, and is made in the direction of the straight-line in which the force
is impressed.
3. To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction; or, the mutual actions of
two bodies upon each other are always equal and directed to contrary parts.
Let us now examine how these laws can be applied to dynamical systems.

2.4 Newton’s First Law of Motion
Newton’s first law of motion essentially states that a point object subject to zero net external force moves in a straight-line with a constant speed (i.e., it does not accelerate).
However, this is only true in special frames of reference called inertial frames. Indeed, we

can think of Newton’s first law as the definition of an inertial frame: i.e., an inertial frame
of reference is one in which a point object subject to zero net external force moves in a
straight-line with constant speed.
Suppose that we have found an inertial frame of reference. Let us set up a Cartesian
coordinate system in this frame. The motion of a point object can now be specified by
giving its position vector, r ≡ (x, y, z), with respect to the origin of the coordinate system,
as a function of time, t. Consider a second frame of reference moving with some constant
velocity u with respect to the first frame. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that
the Cartesian axes in the second frame are parallel to the corresponding axes in the first
frame, that u ≡ (u, 0, 0), and, finally, that the origins of the two frames instantaneously
coincide at t = 0—see Figure 2.1. Suppose that the position vector of our point object is
r ′ ≡ (x ′ , y ′ , z ′ ) in the second frame of reference. It is evident, from Figure 2.1, that at any
given time, t, the coordinates of the object in the two reference frames satisfy
x ′ = x − u t,

(2.1)

y ′ = y,

(2.2)

z ′ = z.

(2.3)

This coordinate transformation was first discovered by Galileo Galilei, and is known as a
Galilean transformation in his honor.
By definition, the instantaneous velocity of the object in our first reference frame is
given by v = dr/dt ≡ (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt), with an analogous expression for the velocity, v ′ , in the second frame. It follows from differentiation of Equations (2.1)–(2.3) with
respect to time that the velocity components in the two frames satisfy
vx′ = vx − u,

(2.4)

vy′ = vy ,

(2.5)

vz′ = vz .

(2.6)

12

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

These equations can be written more succinctly as
v ′ = v − u.

(2.7)

Finally, by definition, the instantaneous acceleration of the object in our first reference
frame is given by a = dv/dt ≡ (dvx /dt, dvy /dt, dvz /dt), with an analogous expression for
the acceleration, a ′ , in the second frame. It follows from differentiation of Equations (2.4)–
(2.6) with respect to time that the acceleration components in the two frames satisfy
ax′ = ax ,

(2.8)

ay′ = ay ,

(2.9)

az′ = az .

(2.10)

These equations can be written more succinctly as
a ′ = a.

(2.11)

According to Equations (2.7) and (2.11), if an object is moving in a straight-line with
constant speed in our original inertial frame (i.e., if a = 0) then it also moves in a (different) straight-line with (a different) constant speed in the second frame of reference (i.e.,
a ′ = 0). Hence, we conclude that the second frame of reference is also an inertial frame.
A simple extension of the above argument allows us to conclude that there are an
infinite number of different inertial frames moving with constant velocities with respect to
one another. Newton thought that one of these inertial frames was special, and defined
an absolute standard of rest: i.e., a static object in this frame was in a state of absolute
rest. However, Einstein showed that this is not the case. In fact, there is no absolute
standard of rest: i.e., all motion is relative—hence, the name “relativity” for Einstein’s
theory. Consequently, one inertial frame is just as good as another as far as Newtonian
dynamics is concerned.
But, what happens if the second frame of reference accelerates with respect to the first?
In this case, it is not hard to see that Equation (2.11) generalizes to
a′ = a −

du
,
dt

(2.12)

where u(t) is the instantaneous velocity of the second frame with respect to the first.
According to the above formula, if an object is moving in a straight-line with constant
speed in the first frame (i.e., if a = 0) then it does not move in a straight-line with constant
speed in the second frame (i.e., a ′ 6= 0). Hence, if the first frame is an inertial frame then
the second is not.
A simple extension of the above argument allows us to conclude that any frame of
reference which accelerates with respect to a given inertial frame is not itself an inertial
frame.
For most practical purposes, when studying the motions of objects close to the Earth’s
surface, a reference frame which is fixed with respect to this surface is approximately

Newton’s Laws of Motion

13

inertial. However, if the trajectory of a projectile within such a frame is measured to
high precision then it will be found to deviate slightly from the predictions of Newtonian
dynamics—see Chapter 7. This deviation is due to the fact that the Earth is rotating, and its
surface is therefore accelerating towards its axis of rotation. When studying the motions of
objects in orbit around the Earth, a reference frame whose origin is the center of the Earth,
and whose coordinate axes are fixed with respect to distant stars, is approximately inertial.
However, if such orbits are measured to extremely high precision then they will again be
found to deviate very slightly from the predictions of Newtonian dynamics. In this case,
the deviation is due to the Earth’s orbital motion about the Sun. When studying the orbits
of the planets in the Solar System, a reference frame whose origin is the center of the Sun,
and whose coordinate axes are fixed with respect to distant stars, is approximately inertial.
In this case, any deviations of the orbits from the predictions of Newtonian dynamics due to
the orbital motion of the Sun about the galactic center are far too small to be measurable.
It should be noted that it is impossible to identify an absolute inertial frame—the best
approximation to such a frame would be one in which the cosmic microwave background
appears to be (approximately) isotropic. However, for a given dynamical problem, it is
always possible to identify an approximate inertial frame. Furthermore, any deviations
of such a frame from a true inertial frame can be incorporated into the framework of
Newtonian dynamics via the introduction of so-called fictitious forces—see Chapter 7.

2.5 Newton’s Second Law of Motion
Newton’s second law of motion essentially states that if a point object is subject to an
external force, f, then its equation of motion is given by
dp
= f,
dt

(2.13)

where the momentum, p, is the product of the object’s inertial mass, m, and its velocity, v.
If m is not a function of time then the above expression reduces to the familiar equation
m

dv
= f.
dt

(2.14)

Note that this equation is only valid in a inertial frame. Clearly, the inertial mass of an
object measures its reluctance to deviate from its preferred state of uniform motion in a
straight-line (in an inertial frame). Of course, the above equation of motion can only be
solved if we have an independent expression for the force, f (i.e., a law of force). Let us
suppose that this is the case.
An important corollary of Newton’s second law is that force is a vector quantity. This
must be the case, since the law equates force to the product of a scalar (mass) and a vector
(acceleration). Note that acceleration is obviously a vector because it is directly related
to displacement, which is the prototype of all vectors—see Appendix A. One consequence
of force being a vector is that two forces, f1 and f2 , both acting at a given point, have the

14

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

same effect as a single force, f = f1 + f2 , acting at the same point, where the summation
is performed according to the laws of vector addition—see Appendix A. Likewise, a single
force, f, acting at a given point, has the same effect as two forces, f1 and f2 , acting at the
same point, provided that f1 + f2 = f. This method of combining and splitting forces is
known as the resolution of forces, and lies at the heart of many calculations in Newtonian
dynamics.
Taking the scalar product of Equation (2.14) with the velocity, v, we obtain
m v·
This can be written

(2.15)

(2.16)

where

(2.17)

The right-hand side of Equation (2.16) represents the rate at which the force does work
on the object: i.e., the rate at which the force transfers energy to the object. The quantity
K represents the energy the object possesses by virtue of its motion. This type of energy
is generally known as kinetic energy. Thus, Equation (2.16) states that any work done on
point object by an external force goes to increase the object’s kinetic energy.
Suppose that, under the action of the force, f, our object moves from point P at time
t1 to point Q at time t2 . The net change in the object’s kinetic energy is obtained by
integrating Equation (2.16):
Z t2
ZQ
∆K =
f · v dt =
f · dr,
(2.18)
K=

t1

P

since v = dr/dt. Here, dr is an element of the object’s path between points P and Q, and
the integral in r represents the net work done by the force as the objects moves along the
path from P to Q.
As described in Section A.15, there are basically two kinds of forces in nature. Firstly,
RQ
those for which line integrals of the type P f · dr depend on the end points, but not on
the
RQ path taken between these points. Secondly, those for which line integrals of the type
f · dr depend both on the end points, and the path taken between these points. The first
P
kind of force is termed conservative, whereas the second kind isRtermed non-conservative. It
Q
was also demonstrated in Section A.15 that if the line integral P f · dr is path independent
then the force f can always be written as the gradient of a scalar field. In other words, all
conservative forces satisfy
f = −∇U,
(2.19)
for some scalar field U(r). Note that
ZQ
∇U · dr ≡ ∆U = U(Q) − U(P),
P

(2.20)

Newton’s Laws of Motion

15

irrespective of the path taken between P and Q. Hence, it follows from Equation (2.18)
that
∆K = −∆U
(2.21)
for conservative forces. Another way of writing this is
E = K + U = constant.

(2.22)

Of course, we recognize this as an energy conservation equation: E is the object’s total
energy, which is conserved; K is the energy the object has by virtue of its motion, otherwise
know as its kinetic energy; and U is the energy the object has by virtue of its position,
otherwise known as its potential energy. Note, however, that we can only write such energy
conservation equations for conservative forces. Gravity is a good example of a conservative
force. Non-conservative forces, on the other hand, do not conserve energy. In general, this
is because of some sort of frictional energy loss which drains energy from the dynamical
system whilst it remains in motion. Note that potential energy is undefined to an arbitrary
additive constant. In fact, it is only the difference in potential energy between different
points in space that is well-defined.

2.6 Newton’s Third Law of Motion
Consider a system of N mutually interacting point objects. Let the ith object, whose mass
is mi , be located at vector displacement ri . Suppose that this object exerts a force fji on the
jth object. Likewise, suppose that the jth object exerts a force fij on the ith object. Newton’s third law of motion essentially states that these two forces are equal and opposite,
irrespective of their nature. In other words,
fij = −fji .

(2.23)

One corollary of Newton’s third law is that an object cannot exert a force on itself. Another corollary is that all forces in the Universe have corresponding reactions. The only
exceptions to this rule are the fictitious forces which arise in non-inertial reference frames
(e.g., the centrifugal and Coriolis forces which appear in rotating reference frames—see
Chapter 7). Fictitious forces do not possess reactions.
It should be noted that Newton’s third law implies action at a distance. In other words,
if the force that object i exerts on object j suddenly changes then Newton’s third law demands that there must be an immediate change in the force that object j exerts on object
i. Moreover, this must be true irrespective of the distance between the two objects. However, we now know that Einstein’s theory of relativity forbids information from traveling
through the Universe faster than the velocity of light in vacuum. Hence, action at a distance is also forbidden. In other words, if the force that object i exerts on object j suddenly
changes then there must be a time delay, which is at least as long as it takes a light ray
to propagate between the two objects, before the force that object j exerts on object i can
respond. Of course, this means that Newton’s third law is not, strictly speaking, correct.

16

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

However, as long as we restrict our investigations to the motions of dynamical systems
on time-scales that are long compared to the time required for light-rays to traverse these
systems, Newton’s third law can be regarded as being approximately correct.
In an inertial frame, Newton’s second law of motion applied to the ith object yields
j6=i

d2 ri
mi 2 =

dt
j=1,N

(2.24)

Note that the summation on the right-hand side of the above equation excludes the case
j = i, since the ith object cannot exert a force on itself. Let us now take the above equation
and sum it over all objects. We obtain
X

i=1,N

j6=i

(2.25)

Consider the sum over forces on the right-hand side of the above equation. Each element
of this sum—fij , say—can be paired with another element—fji , in this case—which is equal
and opposite, according to Newton’s third law. In other words, the elements of the sum
all cancel out in pairs. Thus, the net value of the sum is zero. It follows that the above
equation can be written
d2 rcm
= 0,
(2.26)
M
dt2
P
where M = N
i=1 mi is the total mass. The quantity rcm is the vector displacement of the
center of mass of the system, which is an imaginary point whose coordinates are the mass
weighted averages of the coordinates of the objects that constitute the system: i.e.,
rcm

PN
mi ri

i=1 mi

(2.27)

According to Equation (2.26), the center of mass of the system moves in a uniform straightline, in accordance with Newton’s first law of motion, irrespective of the nature of the
forces acting between the various components of the system.
Now, if the center of mass moves in a uniform straight-line then the center of mass
velocity,
PN

is a constant of the motion. However, the momentum of the ith object takes the form

P=

(2.29)

Newton’s Laws of Motion

A comparison of Equations (2.28) and (2.29) suggests that P is also a constant of the motion. In other words, the total momentum of the system is a conserved quantity, irrespective
of the nature of the forces acting between the various components of the system. This result (which only holds if there is no net external force acting on the system) is a direct
consequence of Newton’s third law of motion.
Taking the vector product of Equation (2.24) with the position vector ri , we obtain

total angular momentum of the system (about the origin) takes the form

(2.33)
li = mi ri ×

i=1,N

Hence, summing Equation (2.30) over all particles, we obtain
i6=j
X
dL
=
ri × fij .
dt i,j=1,N

(2.34)

Consider the sum on the right-hand side of the above equation. A general term, ri × fij ,
in this sum can always be paired with a matching term, rj × fji , in which the indices have
been swapped. Making use of Equation (2.23), the sum of a general matched pair can be
written
ri × fij + rj × fji = (ri − rj ) × fij .
(2.35)
Let us assume that the forces acting between the various components of the system are
central in nature, so that fij is parallel to ri − rj . In other words, the force exerted on
object j by object i either points directly toward, or directly away from, object i, and vice
versa. This is a reasonable assumption, since most of the forces which we encounter in the
world around us are of this type (e.g., gravity). It follows that if the forces are central in
nature then the vector product on the right-hand side of the above expression is zero. We
conclude that
ri × fij + rj × fji = 0,
(2.36)

18

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

for all values of i and j. Thus, the sum on the right-hand side of Equation (2.34) is zero
for any kind of central force. We are left with
dL
= 0.
dt

(2.37)

In other words, the total angular momentum of the system is a conserved quantity, provided
that the different components of the system interact via central forces (and there is no net
external torque acting on the system).

2.7 Non-Isolated Systems
Up to now, we have only considered isolated dynamical systems, in which all of the forces
acting on the system originate within the system itself. Let us now generalize our approach
to deal with non-isolated dynamical systems, in which some of the forces originate outside
the system. Consider a system of N mutually interacting point objects. Let mi and ri be
the mass and position vector of the ith object, respectively. Suppose that the ith object is
subject to two forces. First, an internal force which originates from the other objects in the
system, and second an external force which originates outside the system. In other words,
let the force acting on the ith object take the form
fi =

j6=i
X

fij + Fi ,

(2.38)

j=1,N

where fij is the internal force exerted by object j on object i, and Fi the net external force
acting on object i.
The equation of motion of the ith object is

mi 2 = fi =

is the net external force acting on the system. Here, the sum over the internal forces has
cancelled out in pairs due to Newton’s third law of motion. We conclude that the total
system momentum evolves in time according to the simple equation (2.41) when there
is a net external force acting on the system, but is completely unaffected by the internal
forces. The fact that Equation (2.41) is similar in form to Equation (2.13) suggests that
the center of mass of a system of many point objects has analogous dynamics to a point
object.
Taking ri × Equation (2.39), and summing over all objects, we obtain

where

conclude that the total system angular momentum evolves in time according to the simple
equation (2.43) when there is a net external torque acting on the system, but is completely
unaffected by the internal torques.

3 One-Dimensional Motion

3.1 Introduction
This chapter employs Newton’s laws to investigate one-dimensional motion. Particular
attention is given to the various mathematical techniques commonly used to analyze oscillatory motion.

3.2 Motion in a General One-Dimensional Potential
Consider a point particle of mass m moving in the x-direction, say, under the action of
some x-directed force f(x). Suppose that f(x) is a conservative force: e.g., gravity. In this
case, according to Equation (2.19), we can write
f(x) = −

dU(x)
,
dx

(3.1)

where U(x) is the potential energy of the particle at position x.
Let the curve U(x) take the form shown in Figure 3.1. For instance, this curve might
represent the gravitational potential energy of a cyclist freewheeling in a hilly region.
Observe that we have set the potential energy at infinity to zero (which we are generally
free to do, since potential energy is undefined to an arbitrary additive constant). This is a
fairly common convention. What can we deduce about the motion of the particle in this
potential?
Well, we know that the total energy, E—which is the sum of the kinetic energy, K, and
the potential energy, U—is a constant of the motion—see Equation (2.22). Hence, we can
write
K(x) = E − U(x).
(3.2)
However, we also know that a kinetic energy can never be negative [since K = (1/2) m v2,
and neither m nor v2 can be negative]. Hence, the above expression tells us that the
particle’s motion is restricted to the region (or regions) in which the potential energy curve
U(x) falls below the value E. This idea is illustrated in Figure 3.1. Suppose that the total
energy of the system is E0 . It is clear, from the figure, that the particle is trapped inside one
or other of the two dips in the potential—these dips are generally referred to as potential
wells. Suppose that we now raise the energy to E1 . In this case, the particle is free to enter
or leave each of the potential wells, but its motion is still bounded to some extent, since it
clearly cannot move off to infinity. Finally, let us raise the energy to E2 . Now the particle is
unbounded: i.e., it can move off to infinity. In conservative systems in which it makes sense
to adopt the convention that the potential energy at infinity is zero, bounded systems are
characterized by E < 0, whereas unbounded systems are characterized by E > 0.

Figure 3.1: A potential energy curve.
The above discussion suggests that the motion of an particle moving in a potential
generally becomes less bounded as the total energy E of the system increases. Conversely,
we would expect the motion to become more bounded as E decreases. In fact, if the energy
becomes sufficiently small then it appears likely that the system will settle down in some
equilibrium state in which the particle is stationary. Let us try to identify any prospective
equilibrium states in Figure 3.1. If the particle remains stationary then it must be subject
to zero force (otherwise it would accelerate). Hence, according to Equation (3.1), an
equilibrium state is characterized by
dU
= 0.
dx

(3.3)

In other words, a equilibrium state corresponds to either a maximum or a minimum of the
potential energy curve U(x). It can be seen that the U(x) curve shown in Figure 3.1 has
three associated equilibrium states located at x = x0 , x = x1 , and x = x2 .
Let us now make a distinction between stable equilibrium points and unstable equilibrium points. When the particle is slightly displaced from a stable equilibrium point then
the resultant force f acting on it must always be such as to return it to this point. In other
words, if x = x0 is an equilibrium point then we require


df 
 <0
dx x0

(3.4)

for stability: i.e., if the particle is displaced to the right, so that x − x0 > 0, then the force
must act to the left, so that f < 0, and vice versa. Likewise, if


df 
 >0
dx x0

(3.5)

then the equilibrium point x = x0 is unstable. It follows, from Equation (3.1), that stable

equilibrium points are characterized by

> 0.
dx2

(3.6)

In other words, a stable equilibrium point corresponds to a minimum of the potential
energy curve U(x). Likewise, an unstable equilibrium point corresponds to a maximum
of the U(x) curve. Hence, we conclude that, in Figure 3.1, x = x0 and x = x2 are stable
equilibrium points, whereas x = x1 is an unstable equilibrium point. Of course, this makes
perfect sense if we think of U(x) as a gravitational potential energy curve, so that U is
directly proportional to height. In this case, all we are saying is that it is easy to confine a
low energy mass at the bottom of a valley, but very difficult to balance the same mass on
the top of a hill (since any slight displacement of the mass will cause it to fall down the
hill). Note, finally, that if
d2 U
dU
=
=0
(3.7)
dx
dx2
at any point (or in any region) then we have what is known as a neutral equilibrium
point. We can move the particle slightly away from such a point and it will still remain
in equilibrium (i.e., it will neither attempt to return to its initial state, nor will it continue
to move). A neutral equilibrium point corresponds to a flat spot in a U(x) curve. See
Figure 3.2.
The equation of motion of an particle moving in one dimension under the action of a
conservative force is, in principle, integrable. Since K = (1/2) m v2, the energy conservation equation (3.2) can be rearranged to give

3.3 Velocity Dependent Forces
Consider a particle of mass m moving in one dimension under the action of a force, f,
which is a function of the particle’s speed, v, but not of its displacement, x. Note that
such a force is intrinsically non-conservative [since it clearly cannot be expressed as minus
the gradient of some potential function, U(x)]. Now, the particle’s equation of motion is
written

Let us now consider a specific example. Suppose that an object of mass m falls vertically
under gravity. Let x be the height through which the object has fallen since t = 0, at which
time the object is assumed to be at rest. It follows that x0 = v0 = 0. Suppose that, in
addition to the force of gravity, m g, where g is the gravitational acceleration, our object
is subject to a retarding air resistance force which is proportional to the square of its
instantaneous velocity. The object’s equation of motion is thus

However, when t ≫ vt /g, we get v ≃ vt , since tanh x ≃ 1 for x ≫ 1. It follows that air
resistance prevents the downward velocity of our object from increasing indefinitely as it
falls. Instead, at large times, the velocity asymptotically approaches the so-called terminal
velocity, vt (at which the gravitational and air resistance forces balance).
The equation of motion of our falling object is also written

(3.25)

It follows that our object needs to fall a distance of order xt before it achieves its terminal
velocity.
Incidentally, it is quite easy to account for an air resistance force which scales as the
square of projectile velocity. Let us imaging that our projectile is moving sufficiently rapidly
that air does not have enough time to flow around it, and is instead simply knocked out
of the way. If our projectile has cross-sectional area A, perpendicular to the direction of
its motion, and is moving with speed v, then the mass of air that it knocks out of its way
per second is ρa A v, where ρa is the mass density of air. Suppose that the air knocked out
of the way is pushed in the direction of the projectile’s motion with a speed of order v. It
follows that the air gains momentum per unit time ρa A v2 in the direction of the projectile’s
motion. Hence, by Newton’s third law, the projectile loses the same momentum per unit
time in the direction of its motion. In other words, the projectile is subject to a drag force
of magnitude
fdrag = C ρa A v2
(3.26)

acting in the opposite direction to its motion. Here, C is an O(1) dimensionless constant, known as the drag coefficient, which depends on the exact shape of the projectile.
Obviously, streamlined projectiles, such as arrows, have small drag coefficients, whereas
non-streamlined projectiles, such as bricks, have large drag coefficients. From before, the
terminal velocity of our projectile is vt = (m g/c)1/2, where m is its mass, and c = C ρa A.
Writing m = A d ρ, where d is the typical linear dimension of the projectile, and ρ its mass
density, we obtain
!1/2
ρgd
vt =
.
(3.27)
ρa C
The above expression tells us that large, dense, streamlined projectiles (e.g., medicine
balls) tend to have large terminal velocities, and small, rarefied, non-streamlined projectiles (e.g., feathers) tend to have small terminal velocities. Hence, the former type of
projectile is relatively less affected by air resistance than the latter.

3.4 Simple Harmonic Motion
Consider the motion of a point particle of mass m which is slightly displaced from a stable
equilibrium point at x = 0. Suppose that the particle is moving in the conservative forcefield f(x). According to the analysis of Section 3.2, in order for x = 0 to be a stable
equilibrium point we require both
f(0) = 0,
(3.28)

One-Dimensional Motion

27

and

df(0)
< 0.
dx
Now, our particle obeys Newton’s second law of motion,
m

d2 x
= f(x).
dt2

(3.29)

(3.30)

Let us assume that it always stays fairly close to its equilibrium point. In this case, to a
good approximation, we can represent f(x) via a truncated Taylor expansion about this
point. In other words,
df(0)
x + O(x2 ).
(3.31)
f(x) ≃ f(0) +
dx
However, according to (3.28) and (3.29), the above expression can be written
f(x) ≃ −m ω02 x,

(3.32)

where df(0)/dx = −m ω02 . Hence, we conclude that our particle satisfies the following
approximate equation of motion,
d2 x
+ ω02 x ≃ 0,
dt2

(3.33)

provided that it does not stray too far from its equilibrium point: i.e., provided |x| does not
become too large.
Equation (3.33) is called the simple harmonic equation, and governs the motion of
all one-dimensional conservative systems which are slightly perturbed from some stable
equilibrium state. The solution of Equation (3.33) is well-known:
x(t) = a sin(ω0 t − φ0 ).

(3.34)

The pattern of motion described by above expression, which is called simple harmonic
motion, is periodic in time, with repetition period T0 = 2π/ω0, and oscillates between x =
±a. Here, a is called the amplitude of the motion. The parameter φ0 , known as the phase
angle, simply shifts the pattern of motion backward and forward in time. Figure 3.3 shows
some examples of simple harmonic motion. Here, φ0 = 0, +π/4, and −π/4 correspond to
the solid, short-dashed, and long-dashed curves, respectively.
Note that the frequency, ω0 —and, hence, the period, T0 —of simple harmonic motion is
determined by the parameters appearing in the simple harmonic equation, (3.33). However, the amplitude, a, and the phase angle, φ0 , are the two integration constants of this
second-order ordinary differential equation, and are, thus, determined by the initial conditions: i.e., by the particle’s initial displacement and velocity.
Now, from Equations (3.1) and (3.32), the potential energy of our particle at position
x is approximately
1
U(x) ≃ m ω02 x2 .
(3.35)

where use has been made of Equation (3.34), and the trigonometric identity cos2 θ +
sin2 θ ≡ 1. Note that the total energy is constant in time, as is to be expected for a
conservative system, and is proportional to the amplitude squared of the motion.

3.5 Damped Oscillatory Motion
According to Equation (3.34), a one-dimensional conservative system which is slightly
perturbed from a stable equilibrium point (and then left alone) oscillates about this point
with a fixed frequency and a constant amplitude. In other words, the oscillations never
die away. This is not very realistic, since we know that, in practice, if we slightly perturb a
dynamical system (such as a pendulum) from a stable equilibrium point then it will indeed
oscillate about this point, but these oscillations will eventually die away due to frictional
effects, which are present in virtually all real dynamical systems. In order to model this
process, we need to include some sort of frictional drag force in our perturbed equation of
motion, (3.33).
The most common model for a frictional drag force is one which is always directed in
the opposite direction to the instantaneous velocity of the object upon which it acts, and

One-Dimensional Motion

29

is directly proportional to the magnitude of this velocity. Let us adopt this model. So, our
drag force can be written
dx
fdrag = −2 m ν ,
(3.38)
dt
where ν is a positive constant with the dimensions of frequency. Including such a force in
our perturbed equation of motion, (3.33), we obtain
d2 x
dx
+
2
ν
+ ω02 x = 0.
dt2

(3.39)

Thus, the positive constant ν parameterizes the strength of the frictional damping in our
dynamical system.
Equation (3.39) is a linear second-order ordinary differential equation, which we suspect possesses oscillatory solutions. There is a standard trick for solving such an equation.
We search for complex solutions of the form
x = a e−i ω t ,

(3.40)

where the constants ω and a are both, in general, complex. Of course, the physical solution
is the real part of the above expression: i.e.,
x = |a| cos[arg(a) − Re(ω) t] e Im(ω) t .

(3.41)

Clearly, the modulus and argument of the complex amplitude, a, determine the amplitude
(at t = 0) and phase of the oscillation, respectively, whereas the real and imaginary parts of
the complex frequency, ω, determine its frequency and growth-rate, respectively. Note that
this method of solution is only appropriate for linear differential equations. Incidentally,
the method works because
Re[L(x)] ≡ L(Re[x]),
(3.42)

where x is a complex variable, and L some real linear differential operator which acts on
this variable. [A linear operator satisfies L(a x) = a L(x) for all a and x, where a is a
constant. The differential operator appearing in Equation (3.39) is clearly of this type.]
Substituting Equation (3.40) into Equation (3.39), we obtain
h

i

a −ω2 − i 2 ν ω + ω02 e−i ω t = 0,

(3.43)

which reduces to the following quadratic equation for ω [since a exp(−i ω t) 6= 0]:
ω2 + i 2 ν ω − ω02 = 0.

(3.44)

The solution to this equation is
ω± = −i ν ±

q

ω02 − ν2 .

(3.45)

Thus, the most general physical solution to Equation (3.39) is

where a± are two arbitrary complex constants.
We can distinguish three different cases. In the first case, ν < ω0 , and the motion is

where ωr = ω02 − ν2 , x0 = x(0), and v0 = dx(0)/dt. It can be seen that the solution
oscillates at some real frequency, ωr , which is somewhat less than the natural frequency
of oscillation of the undamped system, ω0 , but also decays exponentially in time at a rate
proportional to the damping coefficient, ν.
In the second case, ν = ω0 , and the motion is said to be critically damped. The most
general solution is written
x(t) = [x0 (1 + ω0 t) + v0 t] e−ω0 t .

(3.48)

It can be seen that the solution now decays without oscillating.
In the third case, ν > ω0 , and the motion is said to be overdamped. The most general
solution is written

where ν± = ν± ν2 − ω02 . It can be seen that the solution again decays without oscillating,
except there are now two independent decay rates. The largest, ν+ , is always greater than
the critically damped decay rate, ω0 , whereas the smaller, ν− , is always less than this decay
rate. This means that, in general, the critically damped solution is more rapidly damped
than either the underdamped or overdamped solutions.

One-Dimensional Motion

Figure 3.4 shows typical examples of underdamped (i.e., ν = ω0 /4), critically damped
(i.e., ν = ω0 ), and overdamped (i.e., ν = 4 ω0 ) solutions, calculated with the initial
conditions x0 = 1 and v0 = 0. Here, T0 = 2π/ω0 . The three solutions correspond to the
solid, short-dashed, and long-dashed curves, respectively.

(3.52)

We conclude that the presence of damping causes the oscillator energy to decrease monotonically in time, and, hence, causes the amplitude of the oscillation to eventually become
negligibly small [see Equation (3.37)].
The energy loss rate of a weakly damped (i.e., ν ≪ ω0 ) oscillator is conveniently characterized in terms of a parameter, Q, which is known as the quality factor. This parameter
is defined to be 2π times the energy stored in the oscillator, divided by the energy lost in a
single oscillation period. If the oscillator is weakly damped then the energy lost per period
is relatively small, and Q is therefore much larger than unity. Roughly speaking, Q is the
number of oscillations that the oscillator typically completes, after being set in motion,
before its amplitude decays to a negligible value. Let us find an expression for Q.
Now, the most general solution for a weakly damped oscillator can be written in the
form [cf., Equation (3.47)]
x = x0 e−ν t cos(ωr t − φ0 ),
(3.53)
where x0 and φ0 are constants, and ωr =

ω02 − ν2 . It follows that

3.7 Resonance
We have seen that when a one-dimensional dynamical system is slightly perturbed from a
stable equilibrium point (and then left alone), it eventually returns to this point at a rate
controlled by the amount of damping in the system. Let us now suppose that the same
system is subject to continuous oscillatory constant amplitude external forcing at some
fixed frequency, ω. In this case, we would expect the system to eventually settle down to
some steady oscillatory pattern of motion with the same frequency as the external forcing.
Let us investigate the properties of this type of driven oscillation.
Suppose that our system is subject to an external force of the form
fext (t) = m ω02 X1 cos(ω t).

(3.60)

Here, X1 is the amplitude of the oscillation at which the external force matches the restoring force, (3.32). Incorporating the above force into our perturbed equation of motion,
(3.39), we obtain

Let us search for a solution of the form (3.40), and represent the right-hand side of the
above equation as ω02 X1 exp(−i ω t). It is again understood that the physical solutions are
the real parts of these expressions. Note that ω is now a real parameter. We obtain

In general, a is a complex quantity. Thus, we can write
a = x1 e i φ1 ,

(3.64)

where x1 and φ1 are both real. It follows from Equations (3.40), (3.63), and (3.64) that
the physical solution takes the form
x(t) = x1 cos(ω t − φ1 ),

(3.67)

We conclude that, in response to the applied sinusoidal force, (3.60), the system executes a
sinusoidal pattern of motion at the same frequency, with fixed amplitude x1 , and phase-lag
φ1 (with respect to the external force).
Let us investigate the variation of x1 and φ1 with the forcing frequency, ω. This is
most easily done graphically. Figure 3.5 shows x1 and φ1 as functions of ω for various
values of ν/ω0 . Here, ν/ω0 = 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 correspond to the solid, dotted,
short-dashed, long-dashed, and dot-dashed curves, respectively. It can be seen that as the
amount of damping in the system is decreased, the amplitude of the response becomes progressively more peaked at the natural frequency of oscillation of the system, ω0 . This effect
is known as resonance, and ω0 is termed the resonant frequency. Thus, a weakly damped
system (i.e., ν ≪ ω0 ) can be driven to large amplitude by the application of a relatively
small external force which oscillates at a frequency close to the resonant frequency. Note
that the response of the system is in phase (i.e., φ1 ≃ 0) with the external driving force

34

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

for driving frequencies well below the resonant frequency, is in phase quadrature (i.e.,
φ1 = π/2) at the resonant frequency, and is in anti-phase (i.e., φ1 ≃ π) for frequencies
well above the resonant frequency.
According to Equation (3.66),
x1 (ω = ω0 )
ω0

x1 (ω = 0)
2ν

(3.68)

In other words, the ratio of the driven amplitude at the resonant frequency to that at
a typical non-resonant frequency (for the same drive amplitude) is of order the quality
factor. Equation (3.66) also implies that, for a weakly damped oscillator (ν ≪ ω0 ),
ν
x1 (ω)
≃

x1 (ω = ω0 )
[(ω − ω0 )2 + ν2 ]1/2

(3.69)

provided |ω − ω0 | ≪ ω0 . Hence, the width of the resonance peak (in frequency) is ∆ω =
2 ν, where the√edges of peak are defined as the points at which the driven amplitude is
reduced to 1/ 2 of its maximum value. It follows that the fractional width is

(3.70)

We conclude that the height and width of the resonance peak of a weakly damped (Q ≫ 1)
oscillator scale as Q and Q−1 , respectively. Thus, the area under the resonance curve stays
approximately constant as Q varies.

3.8 Periodic Driving Forces
In the last section, we investigated the response of a one-dimensional dynamical system,
close to a stable equilibrium point, to an external force which varies as cos(ω t). Let us
now examine the response of the same system to a more complicated external force.
Consider a general external force which is periodic in time, with period T . By analogy
with Equation (3.60), we can write such a force as
fext (t) = m ω02 X(t),

(3.71)

X(t + T ) = X(t)

(3.72)

where
for all t.
It is convenient to represent X(t) as a Fourier series in time, so that
X(t) =

∞
X
n=0

Xn cos(n ω t),

(3.73)

One-Dimensional Motion

35

where ω = 2π/T . By writing X(t) in this form, we automatically satisfy the periodicity
constraint (3.72). [Note that by choosing a cosine Fourier series we are limited to even
functions in t: i.e., X(−t) = X(t). Odd functions in t can be represented by sine Fourier
series, and mixed functions require a combination of cosine and sine Fourier series.] The
constant coefficients Xn are known as Fourier coefficients. But, how do we determine these
coefficients for a given functional form, X(t)?
Well, it follows from the periodicity of the cosine function that
Z
1 T
cos(n ω t) dt = δn 0 ,
(3.74)
T 0
where δn n ′ is unity if n = n ′ , and zero otherwise, and is known as the Kronecker delta
function. Thus, integrating Equation (3.73) in t from t = 0 to t = T , and making use of
Equation (3.74), we obtain
Z
1 T
X0 =
X(t) dt.

It is also easily demonstrated that
Z

(3.76)
cos(n ω t) cos(n ′ ω t) dt = δn n ′ ,

provided n, n ′ > 0. Thus, multiplying Equation (3.73) by cos(n ω t), integrating in t from
t = 0 to t = T , and making use of Equations (3.74) and (3.76), we obtain
Z
2 T
X(t) cos(n ω t) dt
(3.77)
Xn =

for n > 0. Hence, we have now determined the Fourier coefficients of the general periodic
function X(t).

means that if xa (t) and xb (t) represent two independent solutions to this equation then
any linear combination of xa (t) and xb (t) is also a solution. We can exploit the linearity of
the above equation to write the solution in the form

We have now fully determined the response of our dynamical system to a general periodic

As an example, suppose that the external force periodically delivers a brief kick to the
system. For instance, let X(t) = A for 0 ≤ t ≤ T/10 and 9 T/10 < t < T , and X(t) = 0
otherwise (in the period 0 ≤ t ≤ T ). It follows from Equation (3.75) and (3.77) that, in

harmonic in Equation (3.82), which would be impractical. However, we can obtain a fairly
accurate approximate solution by truncating the Fourier series (i.e., by neglecting all the
terms with n > N, where N ≫ 1).
Figure 3.6 shows an example calculation in which the Fourier series is truncated after
100 terms. The parameters used in this calculation are ω = 1.2 ω0 and ν = 0.8 ω0. The
left panel shows the Fourier reconstruction of the driving force, X(t). The glitches at the
rising and falling edges of the pulses are called Gibbs phenomena, and are an inevitable
consequence of attempting to represent a discontinuous periodic function as a Fourier
series. The right panel shows the Fourier reconstruction of the response, x(t), of the
dynamical system to the applied force.

3.9 Transients
We saw, in Section 3.7, that when a one-dimensional dynamical system, close to a stable
equilibrium point, is subject to a sinusoidal external force of the form (3.60) then the
equation of motion of the system is written

(3.88)

We also found that the solution to this equation which oscillates in sympathy with the
applied force takes the form
x(t) = x1 cos(ω t − φ1 ),
(3.89)
where x1 and φ1 are specified in Equations (3.66) and (3.67), respectively. However,
(3.89) is not the most general solution to Equation (3.88). It should be clear that we can
take the above solution and add to it any solution of Equation (3.88) calculated with the
right-hand side set to zero, and the result will also be a solution of Equation (3.88). Now,
we investigated the solutions to (3.88) with the right-hand set to zero in Section 3.5. In
the underdamped regime (ν < ω0 ), we found that the most general such solution takes
the form
x(t) = A e−ν t cos(ωr t) + B e−ν t sin(ωr t),
(3.90)
where A and B are two arbitrary constants [they are in fact the integration
constants of
q

the second-order ordinary differential equation (3.88)], and ωr = ω0 − ν . Thus, the
most general solution to Equation (3.88) is written
x(t) = A e−ν t cos(ωr t) + B e−ν t sin(ωr t) + x1 cos(ω t − φ1 ).

(3.91)

The first two terms on the right-hand side of the above equation are called transients, since
they decay in time. The transients are determined by the initial conditions. However, if
we wait long enough after setting the system into motion then the transients will always

38

decay away, leaving the time-asymptotic solution (3.89), which is independent of the initial
conditions.
As an example, suppose that we set the system into motion at time t = 0 with the initial
conditions x(0) = dx(0)/dt = 0. Setting x(0) = 0 in Equation (3.91), we obtain
A = −x1 cos φ1 .

(3.92)

Moreover, setting dx(0)/dt = 0 in Equation (3.91), we get
B=−

x1 (ν cos φ1 + ω sin φ1 )

(3.93)

Thus, we have now determined the constants A and B, and, hence, fully specified the
solution for t > 0. Figure 3.7 shows this solution (solid curve) calculated for ω = 2 ω0
and ν = 0.2 ω0. Here, T0 = 2π/ω0 . The associated time-asymptotic solution (3.89) is also
shown for the sake of comparison (dashed curve). It can be seen that the full solution
quickly converges to the time-asymptotic solution.

3.10 Simple Pendulum
Consider a compact mass m suspended from a light inextensible string of length l, such
that the mass is free to swing from side to side in a vertical plane, as shown in Figure 3.8.
This setup is known as a simple pendulum. Let θ be the angle subtended between the string
and the downward vertical. Obviously, the stable equilibrium state of the simple pendulum
corresponds to the situation in which the mass is stationary, and hangs vertically down (i.e.,
θ = 0). From elementary mechanics, the angular equation of motion of the pendulum is

where I is the moment of inertia of the mass (see Section 8.3), and τ is the torque acting
about the pivot point (see Section A.7). For the case in hand, given that the mass is
essentially a point particle, and is situated a distance l from the axis of rotation (i.e., the
pivot point), it is easily seen that I = m l2 .
The two forces acting on the mass are the downward gravitational force, m g, where g
is the acceleration due to gravity, and the tension, T , in the string. Note, however, that the
tension makes no contribution to the torque, since its line of action clearly passes through
the pivot point. From simple trigonometry, the line of action of the gravitational force
passes a distance l sin θ from the pivot point. Hence, the magnitude of the gravitational
torque is m g l sin θ. Moreover, the gravitational torque is a restoring torque: i.e., if the
mass is displaced slightly from its equilibrium state (i.e., θ = 0) then the gravitational
torque clearly acts to push the mass back toward that state. Thus, we can write
τ = −m g l sin θ.

(3.95)

Combining the previous two equations, we obtain the following angular equation of motion of the pendulum:
d2 θ
l 2 + g sin θ = 0.
(3.96)
dt
Note that, unlike all of the other equations of motion which we have examined in this
chapter, the above equation is nonlinear [since sin(a θ) 6= a sin θ, except when θ ≪ 1].
Let us assume, as usual, that the system does not stray very far from its equilibrium
state (θ = 0). If this is the case then we can make the small angle approximation sin θ ≃ θ,
and the above equation of motion simplifies to

where ω0 = g/l. Of course, this is just the simple harmonic equation. Hence, we can
immediately write the solution as
θ(t) = θ0 cos(ω0 t).

(3.98)

We conclude that the pendulum swings back and forth at a fixed frequency, ω0 , which
depends on l and g, but is independent of the amplitude, θ0 , of the motion.
Suppose, now, that we desire a more accurate solution of Equation (3.96). One way in
which we could achieve this would be to include more terms in the small angle expansion
of sin θ, which is

(3.100)

By analogy with (3.98), let us try a trial solution of the form
θ(t) = ϑ0 cos(ω t).

(3.101)

Substituting this into Equation (3.100), and making use of the trigonometric identity
cos3 u ≡ (3/4) cos u + (1/4) cos(3 u),

(3.102)

we obtain

ϑ0 ω02 − ω2 − (1/8) ω02 ϑ02 cos(ω t) − (1/24) ω02 ϑ03 cos(3 ω t) ≃ 0.

(3.103)

It is evident that the above equation cannot be satisfied for all values of t, except in the
trivial case ϑ0 = 0. However, the form of this expression does suggest a better trial solution,
namely
θ(t) = ϑ0 cos(ω t) + α ϑ03 cos(3 ω t),
(3.104)
where α is O(1). Substitution of this expression into Equation (3.100) yields

the two expressions in square brackets to zero. This yields

The above expression is only approximate, but it illustrates an important point: i.e., that
the frequency of oscillation of a simple pendulum is not, in fact, amplitude independent.
Indeed, the frequency goes down slightly as the amplitude increases.
The above example illustrates how we might go about solving a nonlinear equation of
motion by means of an expansion in a small parameter (in this case, the amplitude of the
motion).

4 Multi-Dimensional Motion

4.1 Introduction
This chapter employs Newton’s laws to investigate various aspects of multi-dimensional
motion.

4.2 Motion in a Two-Dimensional Harmonic Potential
Consider a particle of mass m moving in the two-dimensional harmonic potential
U(x, y) =
where r =

(4.1)

x2 + y2 , and k > 0. It follows that the particle is subject to a force,
f = −∇U = −k (x, y) = −k r,

(4.2)

which always points towards the origin, and whose magnitude increases linearly with increasing distance from the origin. According to Newton’s second law, the equation of
motion of the particle is
d2 r
(4.3)
m 2 = f = −k r.

When written in component form, the above equation reduces to

where ω0 = k/m.
Since Equations (4.4) and (4.5) are both simple harmonic equations, we can immediately write their general solutions:
x = A cos(ω0 t − φ1 ),

(4.6)

y = B cos(ω0 t − φ2 ).

(4.7)

Here, A, B, φ1 , and φ2 are arbitrary constants of integration. We can simplify the above
equations slightly by shifting the origin of time (which is, after all, arbitrary): i.e.,
t → t ′ + φ1 /ω0 .

(4.8)

46

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

Hence, we obtain
x = A cos(ω0 t ′ ),

(4.9)

′

y = B cos(ω0 t − ∆),

(4.10)

where ∆ = φ2 −φ1 . Note that the motion is clearly periodic in time, with period T = 2 π/ω0.
Thus, the particle must trace out some closed trajectory in the x-y plane. The question, now,
is what does this trajectory look like as a function of the relative phase-shift, ∆, between
the oscillations in the x- and y-directions?
Using standard trigonometry, we can write Equation (4.10) in the form
y = B [cos(ω0 t ′ ) cos ∆ + sin(ω0 t ′ ) sin ∆] .

(4.11)

Hence, using Equation (4.9), we obtain

Unfortunately, the above equation is not immediately recognizable as being the equation
of any particular geometric curve: e.g., a circle, an ellipse, or a parabola, etc.
Perhaps our problem is that we are using the wrong coordinates. Suppose that we
rotate our coordinate axes about the z-axis by an angle θ, as illustrated in Figure A.5.
According to Equations (A.17) and (A.18), our old coordinates (x, y) are related to our
new coordinates (x ′ , y ′ ) via
x = x ′ cos θ − y ′ sin θ,

(4.14)

y = x ′ sin θ + y ′ cos θ.

(4.15)

Let us see whether Equation (4.13) takes a simpler form when expressed in terms of our
new coordinates. Equations (4.13)–(4.15) yield

Of course, we immediately recognize Equation (4.19) as the equation of an ellipse, centered
on the origin, whose major and minor axes are aligned along the x ′ - and y ′ -axes, and
whose major and minor radii are a and b, respectively (assuming that a > b).
We conclude that, in general, a particle of mass m moving in the two-dimensional
harmonic potential (4.1) executes a closed elliptical orbit (which is not necessarily aligned
along
the x- and y-axes), centered on the origin, with period T = 2 π/ω0, where ω0 =
q
k/m.
Figure 4.1 shows some example trajectories calculated for A = 2, B = 1, and the
following values of the phase difference, ∆: (a) ∆ = 0; (b) ∆ = π/4; (c) ∆ = π/2; (d)
∆ = 3π/4. Note that when ∆ = 0 the trajectory degenerates into a straight-line (which can
be thought of as an ellipse whose minor radius is zero).
Perhaps, the main lesson to be learned from the above study of two-dimensional motion
in a harmonic potential is that comparatively simple patterns of motion can be made to
look complicated when expressed in terms of ill-chosen coordinates.

4.3 Projectile Motion with Air Resistance
Suppose that a projectile of mass m is launched, at t = 0, from ground level (in a flat
plain), making an angle θ to the horizontal. Suppose, further, that, in addition to the force
of gravity, the projectile is subject to an air resistance force which acts in the opposite direction to its instantaneous direction of motion, and whose magnitude is directly proportional
to its instantaneous speed. This is not a particularly accurate model of the drag force due
to air resistance (the magnitude of the drag force is typically proportion to the square of
the speed—see Section 3.3), but it does lead to tractable equations of motion. Hence, by
using this model we can, at least, get some idea of how air resistance modifies projectile
trajectories.

Let us adopt a Cartesian coordinate system whose origin coincides with the launch
point, and whose z-axis points vertically upward. Let the initial velocity of the projectile
lie in the x-z plane. Note that, since neither gravity nor the drag force cause the projectile
to move out of the x-z plane, we can effectively ignore the y coordinate in this problem.
The equation of motion of our projectile is written
dv

It thus follows, from Equations (4.27) and (4.30), that if the projectile stays in the air

terminal velocity, vt , irrespective of its initial launch angle.

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

Incidentally, the above analysis implies that air resistance only starts to have an appreciable
effect on the trajectory after the projectile has been in the air a time of order vt /g.
It is clear, from the previous two equations, that the time of flight of the projectile (i.e.,
the time at which z = 0, excluding the trivial result t = 0) is
2 v0 sin θ

tf =

(4.37)

(4.38)

when t ≫ vt /g, which implies that v0 sin θ ≫ vt (i.e., the vertical component of the launch
velocity is much greater than the terminal velocity). It thus follows, from Equations (4.32)
and (4.33), that the horizontal range [i.e., x(tf )] of the projectile is
R=

v02 sin(2 θ)
g

(4.39)

R=

v0 vt cos θ
g

(4.40)

when v0 sin θ ≪ vt , and

when v0 sin θ ≫ vt . Equation (4.39) is, of course, the standard result without air resistance. This result implies that, in the absence of air resistance, the maximum horizontal
range, v02 /g, is achieved when the launch angle θ takes the value 45◦ . On the other hand,
Equation (4.40) implies that, in the presence of air resistance, the maximum horizontal
range, v0 vt /g, is achieved when θ is made as small as possible. However, θ cannot be
made too small, since expression (4.40) is only valid when v0 sin θ ≫ vt . In fact, assuming
that v0 ≫ vt , the maximum horizontal range, v0 vt /g, is achieved when θ ∼ vt /v0 ≪ 1.
We thus conclude that if air resistance is significant then it causes the horizontal range
of the projectile to scale linearly, rather than quadratically, with the launch velocity, v0 .
Moreover, the maximum horizontal range is achieved with a launch angle which is much
shallower than the standard result, 45◦ .
Figure 4.2 shows some example trajectories calculated, from the above model, with the
same launch angle, 45◦ , but with different values of the ratio v0 /vt . Here, X = x/(v02 /g) and
Z = z/(v02 /g). The solid, short-dashed, long-dashed, and dot-dashed curves correspond to
v0 /vt = 0, 1, 2, and 4, respectively. It can be seen that as the air resistance strength
increases (i.e., as v0 /vt increases), the range of the projectile decreases. Furthermore, there
is always an initial time interval during which the trajectory is identical to that calculated
in the absence of air resistance (i.e., v0 /vt = 0). Finally, in the presence of air resistance,
the projectile tends to fall more steeply than it rises. Indeed, in the presence of strong air
resistance (i.e., v0 /vt = 4), the projectile falls almost vertically.

4.4 Charged Particle Motion in Electric and Magnetic Fields
Consider a particle of mass m and electric charge q moving in the uniform electric and
magnetic fields, E and B. Suppose that the fields are “crossed” (i.e., perpendicular to one
another), so that E · B = 0.
The force acting on the particle is given by the familiar Lorentz law:
f = q (E + v × B) ,

Equation (4.42) reduces to

where we have made use of a standard vector identity (see Section A.10), as well as the
fact that E·B = 0. Hence, we conclude that the addition of an electric field perpendicular to

irrespective of its charge or mass. It follows that the electric field has no effect on the
particle’s motion in a frame of reference which is co-moving with the so-called E-cross-B
velocity given above.
Let us suppose that the magnetic field is directed along the z-axis. As we have just seen,
in the E × B frame, the particle’s equation of motion reduces to Equation (4.44), which can

plane perpendicular to the magnetic field with some fixed speed v⊥ , and drifts parallel
to the magnetic field with some fixed speed vk . The fact that the cyclotron frequency
is positive for positively charged particles, and negative for negatively charged particles,
just means that oppositely charged particles gyrate in opposite directions in the plane
perpendicular to the magnetic field.

magnetic field with constant speeds, and gyrate at the cyclotron frequency in the plane
perpendicular to the magnetic field with constant speeds. Oppositely charged particles
gyrate in opposite directions.

5 Planetary Motion

5.1 Introduction
Newtonian dynamics was initially developed in order to account for the motion of the
Planets around the Sun. Let us now investigate this problem.

5.2 Kepler’s Laws
As is well-known, Johannes Kepler was the first astronomer to correctly describe planetary
motion in the Solar System (in works published between 1609 and 1619). The motion of
the Planets is summed up in three simple laws:
1. The planetary orbits are all ellipses which are confocal with the Sun (i.e., the Sun
lies at one of the focii of each ellipse).
2. The radius vectors connecting each planet to the Sun sweep out equal areas in equal
time intervals.
3. The squares of the orbital periods of the planets are proportional to the cubes of their
orbital major radii.
Let us now see if we can derive Kepler’s laws from Newton’s laws of motion.

5.3 Newtonian Gravity
The force which maintains the Planets in orbit around the Sun is called gravity, and was
first correctly described by Isaac Newton (in 1687). According to Newton, any two point
mass objects (or spherically symmetric objects of finite extent) exert a force of attraction
on one another. This force points along the line of centers joining the objects, is directly
proportional to the product of the objects’ masses, and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance between them. Suppose that the first object is the Sun, which is of mass
M, and is located at the origin of our coordinate system. Let the second object be some
planet, of mass m, which is located at position vector r. The gravitational force exerted on
the planet by the Sun is thus written
f=−

GMm
r.
r3

(5.1)

The constant of proportionality, G, is called the gravitational constant, and takes the value
G = 6.67300 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 .

(5.2)

56

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

An equal and opposite force to (5.1) acts on the Sun. However, we shall assume that the
Sun is so much more massive than the planet in question that this force does not cause
the Sun’s position to shift appreciably. Hence, the Sun will always remain at the origin of
our coordinate system. Likewise, we shall neglect the gravitational forces exerted on our
planet by the other planets in the Solar System, compared to the much larger gravitational
force exerted by the Sun.
Incidentally, there is something rather curious about Equation (5.1). According to this
law, the gravitational force acting on an object is directly proportional to its inertial mass.
But why should inertia be related to the force of gravity? After all, inertia measures the reluctance of a given body to deviate from its preferred state of uniform motion in a straightline, in response to some external force. What has this got to do with gravitational attraction? This question perplexed physicists for many years, and was only answered when
Albert Einstein published his general theory of relativity in 1916. According to Einstein,
inertial mass acts as a sort of gravitational charge since it impossible to distinguish an
acceleration produced by a gravitational field from an apparent acceleration generated by
observing in a non-inertial reference frame. The assumption that these two types of acceleration are indistinguishable leads directly to all of the strange predictions of general
relativity: e.g., clocks in different gravitational potentials run at different rates, mass bends
space, etc.
According to Equation (5.1), and Newton’s second law, the equation of motion of our
planet takes the form
d2 r
GM
= − 3 r.
(5.3)
2
dt
r
Note that the planetary mass, m, has canceled out on both sides of the above equation.

5.4 Conservation Laws
Now gravity is a conservative force. Hence, the gravitational force (5.1) can be written (see
Section 2.5)
f = −∇U,
(5.4)
where the potential energy, U(r), of our planet in the Sun’s gravitational field takes the
form
GMm
U(r) = −
.
(5.5)
r
It follows that the total energy of our planet is a conserved quantity—see Section 2.5. In
other words,

is constant in time. Here, E is actually the planet’s total energy per unit mass, and v =
dr/dt.

Gravity is also a central force. Hence, the angular momentum of our planet is a conserved quantity—see Section 2.6. In other words,
h = r × v,

(5.7)

which is actually the planet’s angular momentum per unit mass, is constant in time. Taking
the scalar product of the above equation with r, we obtain
h · r = 0.

(5.8)

This is the equation of a plane which passes through the origin, and whose normal is
parallel to h. Since h is a constant vector, it always points in the same direction. We,
therefore, conclude that the motion of our planet is two-dimensional in nature: i.e., it is
confined to some fixed plane which passes through the origin. Without loss of generality,
we can let this plane coincide with the x-y plane.

5.5 Polar Coordinates
We can determine the instantaneous position of our planet in the x-y plane in terms of
standard Cartesian q
coordinates, (x, y), or polar coordinates, (r, θ), as illustrated in Figure 5.1. Here, r = x2 + y2 and θ = tan−1 (y/x). It is helpful to define two unit vectors,
er ≡ r/r and eθ ≡ ez × er , at the instantaneous position of the planet. The first always
points radially away from the origin, whereas the second is normal to the first, in the direction of increasing θ. As is easily demonstrated, the Cartesian components of er and eθ
are
er = (cos θ, sin θ),
eθ = (− sin θ, cos θ),

respectively.
We can write the position vector of our planet as
r = r er .

(5.11)

Thus, the planet’s velocity becomes
v=

dr
= ṙ er + r ėr ,
dt

(5.12)

where ˙ is shorthand for d/dt. Note that er has a non-zero time-derivative (unlike a Cartesian unit vector) because its direction changes as the planet moves around. As is easily
demonstrated, from differentiating Equation (5.9) with respect to time,
ėr = θ̇ (− sin θ, cos θ) = θ̇ eθ .

(5.13)

v = ṙ er + r θ̇ eθ .

(5.14)

Thus,
Now, the planet’s acceleration is written
a=

d2 r
dv
= 2 = r̈ er + ṙ ėr + (ṙ θ̇ + r θ̈) eθ + r θ̇ ėθ .
dt
dt

(5.15)

Again, eθ has a non-zero time-derivative because its direction changes as the planet moves
around. Differentiation of Equation (5.10) with respect to time yields
ėθ = θ̇ (− cos θ, − sin θ) = −θ̇ er .

(5.16)

a = (r̈ − r θ̇ 2 ) er + (r θ̈ + 2 ṙ θ̇) eθ .

(5.17)

Hence,

It follows that the equation of motion of our planet, (5.3), can be written

(5.19)

and a tangential equation of motion,

5.6 Conic Sections
The ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola are collectively known as conic sections, since
these three types of curve can be obtained by taking various different plane sections of a
right cone. It turns out that the possible solutions of Equations (5.19) and (5.20) are all
conic sections. It is, therefore, appropriate for us to briefly review these curves.
An ellipse, centered on the origin, of major radius a and minor radius b, which are
aligned along the x- and y-axes, respectively (see Figure 5.2), satisfies the following wellknown equation:
x2 y2
+
= 1.
(5.21)
a2 b2
Likewise, a parabola which is aligned along the +x-axis, and passes through the origin
(see Figure 5.3), satisfies:
y2 − b x = 0,
(5.22)
where b > 0.
Finally, a hyperbola which is aligned along the +x-axis, and whose asymptotes intersect
at the origin (see Figure 5.4), satisfies:
x2 y2
−
= 1.
a2 b2

(5.23)

Here, a is the distance of closest approach to the origin. The asymptotes subtend an angle
φ = tan−1 (b/a) with the x-axis.
It is not clear, at this stage, what the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola have
in common (other than being conic sections). Well, it turns out that what these three
curves have in common is that they can all be represented as the locus of a movable
point whose distance from a fixed point is in a constant ratio to its perpendicular distance to some fixed straight-line. Let the fixed point (which is termed the focus of the
ellipse/parabola/hyperbola) lie at the origin, and let the fixed line correspond to x = −d

(with d > 0). Thus, the distance of aqgeneral point (x, y) (which lies to the right of the
line x = −d) from the origin is r1 = x2 + y2 , whereas the perpendicular distance of the
point from the line x = −d is r2 = x + d—see Figure 5.5. In polar coordinates, r1 = r and
r2 = r cos θ + d. Hence, the locus of a point for which r1 and r2 are in a fixed ratio satisfies
the following equation:

Equation (5.26) can be recognized as the equation of an ellipse whose center lies at (xc , 0),
and whose major and minor radii, a and b, are aligned along the x- and y-axes, respectively
[cf., Equation (5.21)].

62

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

When again written in terms of Cartesian coordinates, Equation (5.24) can be rearranged to give
y2 − 2 rc (x − xc ) = 0,
(5.30)
for e = 1. Here, xc = −rc /2. This is the equation of a parabola which passes through the
point (xc , 0), and which is aligned along the +x-direction [cf., Equation (5.22)].
Finally, when written in terms of Cartesian coordinates, Equation (5.24) can be rearranged to give

with the x-axis [cf., Equation (5.23)].
In conclusion, Equation (5.25) is the polar equation of a general conic section which is
confocal with the origin. For e < 1, the conic section is an ellipse. For e = 1, the conic
section is a parabola. Finally, for e > 1, the conic section is a hyperbola.

5.7 Kepler’s Second Law
Multiplying our planet’s tangential equation of motion, (5.20), by r, we obtain
r2 θ̈ + 2 r ṙ θ̇ = 0.

(5.36)

However, the above equation can be also written
d(r2 θ̇)
= 0,
dt

(5.37)

h = r2 θ̇

(5.38)

which implies that
is constant in time. It is easily demonstrated that h is the magnitude of the vector h defined
in Equation (5.7). Thus, the fact that h is constant in time is equivalent to the statement

Planetary Motion

63

that the angular momentum of our planet is a constant of its motion. As we have already
mentioned, this is the case because gravity is a central force.
Suppose that the radius vector connecting our planet to the origin (i.e., the Sun) sweeps
out an angle δθ between times t and t + δt—see Figure 5.6. The approximately triangular
region swept out by the radius vector has the area
δA ≃

1 2
r δθ,

(5.39)

since the area of a triangle is half its base (r δθ) times its height (r). Hence, the rate at

Thus, the radius vector sweeps out area at a constant rate (since h is constant in time)—
this is Kepler’s second law. We conclude that Kepler’s second law of planetary motion is a
direct consequence of angular momentum conservation.

The general solution to the above equation is

(5.47)

We immediately recognize Equation (5.46) as the equation of a conic section which is
confocal with the origin (i.e., with the Sun). Specifically, for e < 1, Equation (5.46) is the
equation of an ellipse which is confocal with the Sun. Thus, the orbit of our planet around
the Sun in a confocal ellipse—this is Kepler’s first law of planetary motion. Of course, a
planet cannot have a parabolic or a hyperbolic orbit, since such orbits are only appropriate
to objects which are ultimately able to escape from the Sun’s gravitational field.
rc =

5.9 Kepler’s Third Law
We have seen that the radius vector connecting our planet to the origin sweeps out area
at the constant rate dA/dt = h/2 [see Equation (5.40)]. We have also seen that the
planetary orbit is an ellipse. Suppose that the major and minor radii of the ellipse are a
and b, respectively. It follows that the area of the ellipse is A = π a b. Now, we expect
the radius vector to sweep out the whole area of the ellipse in a single orbital period, T .
Hence,
2π a b

(5.48)

(dA/dt)

It follows from Equations (5.27), (5.28), and (5.47) that
T2 =

4π2 a3
.
GM

(5.49)

In other words, the square of the orbital period of our planet is proportional to the cube of
its orbital major radius—this is Kepler’s third law.
Note that for an elliptical orbit the closest distance to the Sun—the so-called perihelion
distance—is [see Equations (5.27) and (5.46)]
rc
= a (1 − e).
(5.50)
rp =
1+e

Planetary Motion

65

Likewise, the furthest distance from the Sun—the so-called aphelion distance—is
ra =

rc
= a (1 + e).

(5.51)

It follows that the major radius, a, is simply the mean of the perihelion and aphelion
distances,
rp + ra
a=

(5.52)

The parameter
ra − rp
e=
(5.53)
ra + rp
is called the eccentricity, and measures the deviation of the orbit from circularity. Thus,
e = 0 corresponds to a circular orbit, whereas e → 1 corresponds to an infinitely elongated
elliptical orbit.
As is easily demonstrated from the above analysis, Kepler laws of planetary motion can
be written in the convenient form
r =

a (1 − e2 )

1 − e cos θ

(5.54)

r2 θ̇ = (1 − e2 )1/2 n a2 ,

(5.55)

G M = n2 a3 ,

(5.56)

where a is the mean orbital radius (i.e., the major radius), e the orbital eccentricity, and
n = 2π/T the mean orbital angular velocity.

5.10 Orbital Energies
According to Equations (5.6) and (5.14), the total energy per unit mass of an object in
orbit around the Sun is given by
E=

(5.60)

We conclude that elliptical orbits (e < 1) have negative total energies, whereas parabolic
orbits (e = 1) have zero total energies, and hyperbolic orbits (e > 1) have positive total
energies. This makes sense, since in a conservative system in which the potential energy
at infinity is set to zero [see Equation (5.5)] we expect bounded orbits to have negative
total energies, and unbounded orbits to have positive total energies—see Section 3.2. Thus,
elliptical orbits, which are clearly bounded, should indeed have negative total energies,
whereas hyperbolic orbits, which are clearly unbounded, should indeed have positive total
energies. Parabolic orbits are marginally bounded (i.e., an object executing a parabolic
orbit only just escapes from the Sun’s gravitational field), and thus have zero total energy.
For the special case of an elliptical orbit, whose major radius a is finite, we can write
GM
.
(5.61)
2a
It follows that the energy of such an orbit is completely determined by the orbital major
radius.
Consider an artificial satellite in an elliptical orbit around the Sun (the same considerations also apply to satellites in orbit around the Earth). At perihelion, ṙ = 0, and
Equations (5.57) and (5.60) can be combined to give

Here, vt = r θ̇ is the satellite’s tangential velocity, and vc = G M/rp is the tangential
velocity that it would need in order to maintain a circular orbit at the perihelion distance.
Likewise, at aphelion,
vt √
= 1 − e,
(5.63)
vc
q

where vc = G M/ra is now the tangential velocity that the satellite would need in order
to maintain a circular orbit at the aphelion distance.
Suppose that our satellite is initially in a circular orbit of radius r1 , and that we wish
to transfer it into a circular orbit of radius r2 , where r2 > r1 . We can achieve this by temporarily placing the satellite in an elliptical orbit whose perihelion distance is r1 , and whose
aphelion distance is r2 . It follows, from Equation (5.53), that the required eccentricity of
the elliptical orbit is
r2 − r1
e=
.
(5.64)
r2 + r1
According to Equation (5.62), we can transfer our satellite from its initial circular orbit
into the temporary elliptical orbit by increasing its tangential velocity (by briefly switching
on the satellite’s rocket motor) by a factor

(5.66)

The satellite will now be in a circular orbit at the aphelion distance, r2 . This process
is illustrated in Figure 5.7. Obviously, we can transfer our satellite from a larger to a
smaller circular orbit by performing the above process in reverse. Note, finally, from Equation (5.62), that if we increase the
√ tangential velocity of a satellite in a circular orbit about
the Sun by a factor greater than 2 then we will transfer it into a hyperbolic orbit (e > 1),
and it will eventually escape from the Sun’s gravitational field.

5.11 Kepler Problem
In a nutshell, the so-called Kepler problem consists of determining the radial and angular
coordinates, r and θ, respectively, of an object in a Keplerian orbit about the Sun as a
function of time.
Consider an object in a general Keplerian orbit about the Sun which passes through its
perihelion point, r = rp and θ = 0, at t = 0. It follows from the previous analysis that

5.13 Motion in a Nearly Circular Orbit
In principle, a circular orbit is a possible orbit for any attractive central force. However,
not all forces result in stable circular orbits. Let us now consider the stability of circular
orbits in a general central force-field. Equation (5.41) generalizes to
r̈ −

h2
= f(r),
r3

(5.96)

where f(r) is the radial force per unit mass. For a circular orbit, r̈ = 0, and the above
equation reduces to
h2
− 3 = f(rc ),
(5.97)
rc
where rc is the radius of the orbit.
Let us now consider small departures from circularity. Let
x = r − rc .

(5.98)

Equation (5.96) can be written
ẍ −

h2
= f(rc + x).
(rc + x)3

(5.99)

Expanding the two terms involving rc + x as power series in x/rc , and keeping all terms up
to first order, we obtain

to

ẍ + −
− f (rc ) x = 0.
(5.101)

If the term in square brackets is positive then we obtain a simple harmonic equation, which
we already know has bounded solutions—i.e., the orbit is stable to small perturbations. On
the other hand, if the term is square brackets is negative then we obtain an equation whose
solutions grow exponentially in time—i.e., the orbit is unstable to small oscillations. Thus,
the stability criterion for a circular orbit of radius rc in a central force-field characterized
by a radial force (per unit mass) function f(r) is
f(rc ) +

rc ′
f (rc ) < 0.

(5.102)

For example, consider an attractive power-law force function of the form
f(c) = −c rn,

(5.103)

72

where c > 0. Substituting into the above stability criterion, we obtain
−c rcn −

cn n
r < 0,
3 c

(5.104)

or
(5.105)

n > −3.

We conclude that circular orbits in attractive central force-fields which decay faster than
r−3 are unstable. The case n = −3 is special, since the first-order terms in the expansion
of Equation (5.99) cancel out exactly, and it is necessary to retain the second-order terms.
Doing this, it is easily demonstrated that circular orbits are also unstable for inverse-cube
(n = −3) forces.
An apsis is a point in an orbit at which the radial distance, r, assumes either a maximum or a minimum value. Thus, the perihelion and aphelion points are the apsides of
planetary orbits. The angle through which the radius vector rotates in going between two
consecutive apsides is called the apsidal angle. Thus, the apsidal angle for elliptical orbits
in an inverse-square force-field is π.
For the case of stable nearly circular orbits, we have seen that r oscillates sinusoidally
about its mean value, rc . Indeed, it is clear from Equation (5.101) that the period of the
oscillation is
2π
T=
.
(5.106)
[−3 f(rc )/rc − f ′ (rc )]1/2
The apsidal angle is the amount by which θ increases in going between a maximum and
a minimum of r. The time taken to achieve this is clearly T/2. Now, θ̇ = h/r2 , where h is
a constant of the motion, and r is almost constant. Thus, θ̇ is approximately constant. In
fact,

c > 0, the apsidal angle becomes
ψ=

π
.
(3 + n)1/2

(5.109)

Now, it should be clear that if an orbit is going to close on itself then the apsidal angle
needs to be a rational fraction of 2π. There are, in fact, only two small integer values of
the power-law index, n, for which this is the case. As we have seen, for an inverse-square
force law (i.e., n = −2), the apsidal angle is π. For a linear force law (i.e., n = 1), the
apsidal angle is π/2—see Section 4.2. However, for quadratic (i.e., n = 2) or cubic (i.e.,

Planetary Motion

73

n = 3) force laws, the apsidal angle is an irrational fraction of 2π, which means that
non-circular orbits in such force-fields never close on themselves.
Let us, finally, calculate the apsidal angle for a nearly circular orbit of radius rc in a
slightly modified (attractive) inverse-square force law of the form

(5.112)

We conclude that if ǫ > 0 then the perihelion (or aphelion) of the orbit advances by an angle 2 ǫ/(k rc2) every rotation period. It turns out that the general relativistic corrections to
Newtonian gravity give rise to a small 1/r4 modification (with ǫ > 0) to the Sun’s gravitational field. Hence, these corrections generate a small precession in the perihelion of each
planet orbiting the Sun. This effect is particularly large for Mercury—see Section 12.13.

the planet’s angular motion appears uniform when viewed from a point (called the Equant)

6.1 Introduction
This chapter examines the motion of dynamical systems consisting of two freely moving
and mutually interacting point objects.

6.2 Reduced Mass
Suppose that our first object is of mass m1 , and is located at position vector r1 . Likewise,
our second object is of mass m2 , and is located at position vector r2 . Let the first object
exert a force f21 on the second. By Newton’s third law, the second object exerts an equal
and opposite force, f12 = −f21 , on the first. Suppose that there are no other forces in the
problem. The equations of motion of our two objects are thus
d2 r1

d2 r2

(6.1)
(6.2)

where f = f21 .
Now, the center of mass of our system is located at

Hence, we can write

(6.5)

where r = r2 − r1 . Substituting the above two equations into Equations (6.1) and (6.2),
and making use of the fact that the center of mass of an isolated system does not accelerate
(see Section 2.6), we find that both equations yield

is called the reduced mass. Hence, we have effectively converted our original two-body
problem into an equivalent one-body problem. In the equivalent problem, the force f is
the same as that acting on both objects in the original problem (modulo a minus sign).
However, the mass, µ, is different, and is less than either of m1 or m2 (which is why it is
called the “reduced” mass).

6.3 Binary Star Systems
Approximately half of the stars in our galaxy are members of so-called binary star systems.
Such systems consist of two stars orbiting about their common center of mass. The distance
separating the stars is always much less than the distance to the nearest neighbour star.
Hence, a binary star system can be treated as a two-body dynamical system to a very good
approximation.
In a binary star system, the gravitational force which the first star exerts on the second
is
G m1 m2
f=−
r,
(6.8)
r3
where r = r2 −r1 . As we have seen, a two-body system can be reduced to an equivalent onebody system whose equation of motion is of the form (6.6), where µ = m1 m2 /(m1 + m2 ).
Hence, in this particular case, we can write

denote the positions of the first and second star, respectively (which are always diagrammatically opposite one another, as indicated by the arrows). It can be seen that both stars
execute elliptical orbits about their common center of mass.
Binary star systems have been very useful to astronomers, since it is possible to determine the masses of both stars in such a system by careful observation. The sum of the
masses of the two stars, M = m1 +m2 , can be found from Equation (6.16) after a measurement of the major radius, a (which is the mean of the greatest and smallest distance apart
of the two stars during their orbit), and the orbital period, T . The ratio of the masses of

the two stars, m1 /m2 , can be determined from Equations (6.17) and (6.18) by observing
the fixed ratio of the relative distances of the two stars from the common center of mass
about which they both appear to rotate. Obviously, given the sum of the masses, and the
ratio of the masses, the individual masses themselves can then be calculated.

6.4 Scattering in the Center of Mass Frame
Let us now consider scattering due to the collision of two particles. We shall restrict our
discussion to particles which interact via conservative central forces. It turns out that scattering looks particularly simple when viewed in the center of mass frame. Let us, therefore,
start our investigation by considering two-particle scattering in the center of mass frame.
As before, the first particle is of mass m1 , and is located at position vector r1 , whereas
the second particle is of mass m2 , and is located at r2 . By definition, there is zero net linear
momentum in the center of mass frame at all times. Hence, if the first particle approaches
the collision point with momentum p then the second must approach with momentum
−p. Likewise, after the collision, if the first particle recedes from the collision point with
momentum p ′ then the second must recede with momentum −p ′ —see Figure 6.2. Furthermore, since the interaction force is conservative, the total kinetic energy before and
after the collision must be the same. It follows that the magnitude of the final momentum
vector, p ′ , is equal to the magnitude of the initial momentum vector, p. Because of this, the
collision event is completely specified once the angle θ through which the first particle is
scattered is given. Of course, in the center of mass frame, the second particle is scattered
through the same angle—see Figure 6.2.
Suppose that the two particles interact via the potential U(r), where r is the distance
separating the particles. As we have seen, the two-body problem sketched in Figure 6.2
can be converted into the equivalent one-body problem sketched in Figure 6.3. In this

equivalent problem, a particle of mass µ = m1 m2 /(m1 + m2 ) is scattered in the fixed
potential U(r), where r is now the distance from the origin. The vector position r of the
particle in the equivalent problem corresponds to the relative position vector r2 − r1 in the
original problem. It follows that the angle θ through which the particle is scattered in the
equivalent problem is the same as the scattering angle θ in the original problem.
The scattering angle, θ, is largely determined by the so-called impact parameter, b,
which is the distance of closest approach of the two particles in the absence of an interaction
potential. In the equivalent problem, b is the distance of closest approach to the origin in
the absence of an interaction potential—see Figure 6.3. If b = 0 then we have a head-on
collision. In this case, we expect the two particles to reverse direction after colliding: i.e.,
we expect θ = π. Likewise, if b is large then we expect the two particles to miss one
another entirely, in which case θ = 0. It follows that the scattering angle, θ, is a decreasing
function of the impact parameter, b.
Suppose that the polar coordinates of the particle in the equivalent problem are (r, ϑ).
Let the particle approach the origin from the direction ϑ = 0, and attain its closest distance
to the origin when ϑ = Θ. From symmetry, the angle α in Figure 6.3 is equal to the angle
β. However, from simple geometry, α = Θ. Hence,
θ = π − 2 Θ.

(6.19)

Now, by analogy with Equation (5.58), the conserved total energy E in the equivalent
problem, which can easily be shown to be the same as the total energy in the original
problem, is given by

(du/dϑ)umax = 0, it follows from Equation (6.23) that
1 − b2 u2max − U(umax )/E = 0.

(6.25)

Equations (6.19) and (6.24) enable us to calculate the function b(θ) for a given interaction
potential, U(r), and a given total energy, E, of the two particles in the center of mass frame.
The function b(θ) tells us which impact parameter corresponds to which scattering angle,
and vice versa.
Instead of two particles, suppose that we now have two counter-propagating beams of
identical particles (with the same properties as the two particles described above) which
scatter one another via binary collisions. What is the angular distribution of the scattered
particles? Consider pairs of particles whose impact parameters lie in the range b to b + db.
These particles are scattered in such a manner that their scattering angles lie in the range
θ to θ + dθ, where θ is determined from inverting the function b(θ), and
dθ =

db
.
|db(θ)/dθ|

(6.26)

Incidentally, we must take the modulus of db(θ)/dθ because b(θ) is a decreasing function
of θ. Assuming, as seems reasonable, that the scattering is azimuthally symmetric, the
range of solid angle into which the particles are scattered is
dΩ = 2π sin θ dθ =

2π sin θ db
|db/dθ|

(6.27)

Finally, the cross-sectional area of the annulus through which incoming particles must pass
if they are to have impact parameters in the range b to b + db is
dσ = 2π b db.

(6.28)

The previous two equations allow us to define the differential scattering cross-section:

(6.29)

The differential scattering cross-section has units of area per steradian, and specifies the
effective target area for scattering into a given range of solid angle. For two uniform
beams scattering off one another, the differential scattering cross-section thus effectively
specifies the probability of scattering into a given range of solid angle. The total scattering
cross-section is the integral of the differential cross-section over all solid angles,
Z

and measures the effective target area for scattering in any direction. Thus, if the flux of
particles per unit area per unit time, otherwise known as the intensity, of the two beams is
I, then the number of particles of a given type scattered per unit time is simply I σ.
Let us now calculate the scattering cross-section for the following very simple interaction potential:

U(r) =

(6.31)

r≤a

This is the interaction potential of impenetrable spheres which only exert a force on one
another when they are in physical contact (e.g., billiard balls). If the particles in the first
beam have radius R1 , and the particles in the second beam have radius R2 , then a = R1 +R2 .
In other words, the centers of two particles, one from either beam, can never be less than
a distance a apart, where a is the sum of their radii (since the particles are impenetrable
spheres).

We thus conclude that when two beams of impenetrable spheres collide, in the center of

any direction. The total scattering cross-section is

Obviously, this result makes a lot of sense—the total scattering cross-section for two impenetrable spheres is simply the area of a circle whose radius is the sum of the radii of the

There are a number of things to note about the above formula. First, the scattering crosssection is proportional to k2 . This means that repulsive (k > 0) and attractive (k < 0)

Two-Body Dynamics

85

inverse-square interaction forces of the same strength give rise to identical angular distributions of scattered particles. Second, the scattering cross-section is proportional to E−2 .
This means that inverse-square interaction forces are much more effective at scattering low
energy, rather than high energy, particles. Finally, the differential scattering cross-section is
proportional to sin−4 (θ/2). This means that, with an inverse-square interaction force, the
overwhelming majority of “collisions” consist of small angle scattering events (i.e., θ ≪ 1).
Let us now consider a specific case. Suppose that we have particles of electric charge q
scattering off particles of the same charge. The interaction potential due to the Coulomb
force between the particles is simply
U(r) =

q2

This very famous formula is known as the Rutherford scattering cross-section, since it was
first derived by Earnst Rutherford for use in his celebrated α-particle scattering experiment.
Note, finally, that if we try to integrate the Rutherford formula to obtain the total
scattering cross-section then we find that the integral is divergent, due to the very strong
increase in dσ/dΩ as θ → 0. This implies that the Coulomb potential (or any other
inverse-square-law potential) has an effectively infinite range. In practice, however, an
electric charge is generally surrounded by charges of the opposite sign which shield the
Coulomb potential of the charge beyond a certain distance. This shielding effect allows
the charge to have a finite total scattering cross-section (for the scattering of other electric
charges). However, the total scattering cross-section of the charge depends (albeit, logarithmically) on the shielding distance, and, hence, on the nature and distribution of the
charges surrounding it.

6.5 Scattering in the Laboratory Frame
We have seen that two-particle scattering looks fairly simple when viewed in the center of
mass frame. Unfortunately, we are not usually in a position to do this. In the laboratory,
the most common scattering scenario is one in which the second particle is initially at rest.
Let us now investigate this situation.
Suppose that, in the center of mass frame, the first particle has velocity v1 before the
collision, and velocity v1′ after the collision. Likewise, the second particle has velocity v2
before the collision, and v2′ after the collision. We know that
m1 v1 + m2 v2 = m1 v1′ + m2 v2′ = 0

in the center of mass frame. Moreover, since the collision is assumed to be elastic (i.e.,
energy conserving),
v1′ = v1 ,

(6.48)

v2′ = v2 .

(6.49)

Let us transform to a new inertial frame of reference—which we shall call the laboratory
frame—which is moving with the uniform velocity −v2 with respect to the center of mass
frame. In the new reference frame, the first particle has initial velocity V1 = v1 − v2 , and
final velocity V1′ = v1′ − v2 . Furthermore, the second particle is initially at rest, and has the
final velocity V2′ = v2′ − v2 . The relationship between scattering in the center of mass frame
and scattering in the laboratory frame is illustrated in Figure 6.4.
In the center of mass frame, both particles are scattered through the same angle θ.
However, in the laboratory frame, the first and second particles are scattered by the (generally different) angles ψ and ζ, respectively.
Defining x- and y-axes, as indicated in Figure 6.4, it is easily seen that the Cartesian
components of the various velocity vectors in the two frames of reference are:
v1 = v1 (1, 0),

(6.50)

v2 = (m1 /m2 ) v1 (−1, 0),

(6.51)

v1′ = v1 (cos θ, sin θ),

(6.52)

v2′ = (m1 /m2 ) v1 (− cos θ, − sin θ),

(6.53)

V1 = (1 + m1 /m2 ) v1 (1, 0),

(6.54)

V1′ = v1 (cos θ + m1 /m2 , sin θ),

(6.55)

V2′

(6.56)

= (m1 /m2 ) v1 (1 − cos θ, − sin θ).

In the center of mass frame, let E be the total energy, let E1 = (1/2) m1 v12 and E2 =
(1/2) m2 v22 be the kinetic energies of the first and second particles, respectively, before the
collision, and let E1′ = (1/2) m1 v1′ 2 and E2′ = (1/2) m2 v2′ 2 be the kinetic energies of the first

Two-Body Dynamics

87

and second particles, respectively, after the collision. Of course, E = E1 + E2 = E1′ + E2′ .
In the laboratory frame, let E be the total energy. This is, of course, equal to the kinetic
energy of the first particle before the collision. Likewise, let E1′ = (1/2) m1 V1′ 2 and E2′ =
(1/2) m2 V2′ 2 be the kinetic energies of the first and second particles, respectively, after the
collision. Of course, E = E1′ + E2′ .
The following results can easily be obtained from the above definitions and Equations (6.50)–(6.56). First,

Thus, tan ψ attains an extreme value, which can be shown to correspond to a maximum
possible value of ψ, when the numerator of the above expression is zero: i.e., when

(6.68)
ψmax = sin

Hence, we conclude that when m1 > m2 there is a maximum possible value of the scattering angle, ψ, in the laboratory frame. This maximum value is always less than π/2,
which implies that there is no backward scattering (i.e., ψ > π/2) at all when m1 > m2 .
For the special case when m1 = m2 , the maximum scattering angle is π/2. However, for
m1 < m2 there is no maximum value, and the scattering angle in the laboratory frame can
thus range all the way to π.
Equations (6.57)–(6.64) enable us to relate the particle energies and scattering angles
in the laboratory frame to those in the center of mass frame. In general, these relationships
are fairly complicated. However, there are two special cases in which the relationships
become much simpler.
The first special case is when m2 ≫ m1 . In this limit, it is easily seen from Equations (6.57)–(6.64) that the second mass is stationary both before and after the collision,
and that the center of mass frame coincides with the laboratory frame (since the energies
and scattering angles in the two frames are the same). Hence, the simple analysis outlined
in Section 6.4 is applicable in this case.
The second special case is when m1 = m2 . In this case, Equation (6.62) yields

tan ψ =

Hence,

In other words, the scattering angle of the first particle in the laboratory frame is half of
the scattering angle in the center of mass frame. The above equation can be combined
with Equation (6.64) to give
π
ψ+ζ= .
(6.71)

Thus, in the laboratory frame, the two particles move off at right-angles to one another
after the collision. Equation (6.57) yields
ψ=

E = 2 E.

(6.72)

Two-Body Dynamics

In other words, the total energy in the laboratory frame is twice that in the center of mass
frame. According to Equations (6.58) and (6.59),
E1 = E1′ = E2 = E2′ =

E
.
2

(6.73)

Hence, the total energy in the center of mass frame is divided equally between the two
particles. Finally, Equations (6.60) and (6.61) give

Thus, in the laboratory frame, the unequal energy distribution between the two particles
after the collision is simply related to the scattering angle ψ.
What is the angular distribution of scattered particles when a beam of particles of
the first type scatter off stationary particles of the second type? Well, we can define a
differential scattering cross-section, dσ(ψ)/dΩ ′ , in the laboratory frame, where dΩ ′ =
2π sin ψ dψ is an element of solid angle in this frame. Thus, (dσ(ψ)/dΩ ′ ) dΩ ′ is the effective cross-sectional area in the laboratory frame for scattering into the range of scattering
angles ψ to ψ + dψ. Likewise, (dσ(θ)/dΩ) dΩ is the effective cross-sectional area in the
center of mass frame for scattering into the range of scattering angles θ to θ + dθ. Note
that dΩ = 2π sin θ dθ. However, a cross-sectional area is not changed when we transform
between different inertial frames. Hence, we can write
dσ(θ)

dΩ ′ =

where a is the sum of the radii. According to Equation (6.79), the differential scattering
cross-section (for equal mass spheres) in the laboratory frame is

(6.81)
dΩ ′
Note that this cross-section is negative for ψ > π/2. This just tells us that there is no
scattering with scattering angles greater than π/2 (i.e., there is no backward scattering).
Comparing Equations (6.80) and (6.81), we can see that the scattering is isotropic in the
center of mass frame, but appears concentrated in the forward direction in the laboratory
frame. We can integrate Equation (6.81) over all solid angles to obtain the total scattering
cross-section in the laboratory frame. Note that we only integrate over angular regions
where the differential scattering cross-section is positive. Doing this, we get
σ = π a2 ,

(6.82)

which is the same as the total scattering cross-section in the center of mass frame [see
Equation (6.36)]. This is a general result. The total scattering cross-section is frame independent, since a cross-sectional area is not modified by switching between different frames
of reference.

absence of backward scattering.

7 Rotating Reference Frames

7.1 Introduction
As we saw in Chapter 2, Newton’s second law of motion is only valid in inertial frames
of reference. Unfortunately, we are sometimes forced to observe motion in non-inertial
reference frames. For instance, it is most convenient for us to observe the motions of the
objects in our immediate vicinity in a reference frame which is fixed relative to the surface
of the Earth. Such a frame is non-inertial in nature, since it accelerates with respect to
a standard inertial frame due to the Earth’s daily rotation about its axis. (Note that the
accelerations of this frame due to the Earth’s orbital motion about the Sun, or the Sun’s
orbital motion about the galactic center, etc., are negligible compared to the acceleration
due to the Earth’s axial rotation.) Let us now investigate motion in a rotating reference
frame.

7.2 Rotating Reference Frames
Suppose that a given object has position vector r in some non-rotating inertial reference
frame. Let us observe the motion of this object in a non-inertial reference frame which
rotates with constant angular velocity Ω about an axis passing through the origin of the
inertial frame. Suppose, first of all, that our object appears stationary in the rotating
reference frame. Hence, in the non-rotating frame, the object’s position vector r will appear
to precess about the origin with angular velocity Ω. It follows, from Equation (A.49), that
in the non-rotating reference frame
dr
= Ω × r.
dt

(7.1)

Suppose, now, that our object appears to move in the rotating reference frame with instantaneous velocity v ′ . It is fairly obvious that the appropriate generalization of the above
equation is simply
dr
= v ′ + Ω × r.
(7.2)
dt
Let and d/dt and d/dt ′ denote apparent time derivatives in the non-rotating and rotating frames of reference, respectively. Since an object which is stationary in the rotating
reference frame appears to move in the non-rotating frame, it is clear that d/dt 6= d/dt ′ .
Writing the apparent velocity, v ′ , of our object in the rotating reference frame as dr/dt ′ ,
the above equation takes the form
dr
dr
= ′ + Ω × r,
dt

or

d
d
= ′ + Ω×,
(7.4)

since r is a general position vector. Equation (7.4) expresses the relationship between
apparent time derivatives in the non-rotating and rotating reference frames.
Operating on the general position vector r with the time derivative (7.4), we get
v = v ′ + Ω × r.

(7.5)

This equation relates the apparent velocity, v = dr/dt, of an object with position vector
r in the non-rotating reference frame to its apparent velocity, v ′ = dr/dt ′, in the rotating
reference frame.
Operating twice on the position vector r with the time derivative (7.4), we obtain
a=

d
+ Ω× (v ′ + Ω × r) ,
′
dt

(7.6)

or
a = a ′ + Ω × (Ω × r) + 2 Ω × v ′ .

(7.7)

This equation relates the apparent acceleration, a = d2 r/dt2 , of an object with position
vector r in the non-rotating reference frame to its apparent acceleration, a ′ = d2 r/dt ′2, in
the rotating reference frame.
Applying Newton’s second law of motion in the inertial (i.e., non-rotating) reference
frame, we obtain
m a = f.
(7.8)
Here, m is the mass of our object, and f is the (non-fictitious) force acting on it. Note that
these quantities are the same in both reference frames. Making use of Equation (7.7), the
apparent equation of motion of our object in the rotating reference frame takes the form
m a ′ = f − m Ω × (Ω × r) − 2 m Ω × v ′ .

(7.9)

The last two terms in the above equation are so-called “fictitious forces”. Such forces
are always needed to account for motion observed in non-inertial reference frames. Note
that fictitious forces can always be distinguished from non-fictitious forces in Newtonian
dynamics because the former have no associated reactions. Let us now investigate the two
fictitious forces appearing in Equation (7.9).

7.3 Centrifugal Acceleration
Let our non-rotating inertial frame be one whose origin lies at the center of the Earth, and
let our rotating frame be one whose origin is fixed with respect to some point, of latitude
λ, on the Earth’s surface—see Figure 7.1. The latter reference frame thus rotates with
respect to the former (about an axis passing through the Earth’s center) with an angular

object which is stationary with respect to the Earth’s surface. According to Equation (7.9),
the object’s apparent equation of motion in the rotating frame takes the form
m a ′ = f − m Ω × (Ω × r).

(7.11)

Let the non-fictitious force acting on our object be the force of gravity, f = m g. Here,
the local gravitational acceleration, g, points directly toward the center of the Earth. It
follows, from the above, that the apparent gravitational acceleration in the rotating frame
is written
g ′ = g − Ω × (Ω × R),
(7.12)
where R is the displacement vector of the origin of the rotating frame (which lies on the
Earth’s surface) with respect to the center of the Earth. Here, we are assuming that our
object is situated relatively close to the Earth’s surface (i.e., r ≃ R).
It can be seen, from Equation (7.12), that the apparent gravitational acceleration of a
stationary object close to the Earth’s surface has two components. First, the true gravitational acceleration, g, of magnitude g ≃ 9.8 m/s2 , which always points directly toward the
center of the Earth. Second, the so-called centrifugal acceleration, −Ω × (Ω × R). This
acceleration is normal to the Earth’s axis of rotation, and always points directly away from
this axis. The magnitude of the centrifugal acceleration is Ω2 ρ = Ω2 R cos λ, where ρ is
the perpendicular distance to the Earth’s rotation axis, and R = 6.37 × 106 m is the Earth’s
radius—see Figure 7.2.

It is convenient to define Cartesian axes in the rotating reference frame such that the
z -axis points vertically upward, and x ′ - and y ′ -axes are horizontal, with the x ′ -axis pointing directly northward, and the y ′ -axis pointing directly westward—see Figure 7.1. The
Cartesian components of the Earth’s angular velocity are thus
′

Ω = Ω (cos λ, 0, sin λ),

(7.13)

whilst the vectors R and g are written
R = (0, 0, R),

(7.14)

g = (0, 0, −g),

(7.15)

respectively. It follows that the Cartesian coordinates of the apparent gravitational acceleration, (7.12), are




g ′ = −Ω2 R cos λ sin λ, 0, −g + Ω2 R cos2 λ .
The magnitude of this acceleration is approximately

g ′ ≃ g − Ω2 R cos2 λ ≃ 9.8 − 0.034 cos2 λ m/s2 .

(7.16)

(7.17)

According to the above equation, the centrifugal acceleration causes the magnitude of the
apparent gravitational acceleration on the Earth’s surface to vary by about 0.3%, being
largest at the poles, and smallest at the equator. This variation in apparent gravitational
acceleration, due (ultimately) to the Earth’s rotation, causes the Earth itself to bulge slightly
at the equator (see Section 12.6), which has the effect of further intensifying the variation,
since a point on the surface of the Earth at the equator is slightly further away from the
Earth’s center than a similar point at one of the poles (and, hence, the true gravitational
acceleration is slightly weaker in the former case).

Rotating Reference Frames

97

Another consequence of centrifugal acceleration is that the apparent gravitational acceleration on the Earth’s surface has a horizontal component aligned in the north/south
direction. This horizontal component ensures that the apparent gravitational acceleration
does not point directly toward the center of the Earth. In other words, a plumb-line on
the surface of the Earth does not point vertically downward, but is deflected slightly away
from a true vertical in the north/south direction. The angular deviation from true vertical
can easily be calculated from Equation (7.16):
θdev ≃ −

Ω2 R
sin(2 λ) ≃ −0.1◦ sin(2 λ).
2g

(7.18)

Here, a positive angle denotes a northward deflection, and vice versa. Thus, the deflection
is southward in the northern hemisphere (i.e., λ > 0) and northward in the southern hemisphere (i.e., λ < 0). The deflection is zero at the poles and at the equator, and reaches its
maximum magnitude (which is very small) at middle latitudes.

7.4 Coriolis Force
We have now accounted for the first fictitious force, −m Ω × (Ω × r), in Equation (7.9).
Let us now investigate the second, which takes the form −2 m Ω × v ′ , and is called the
Coriolis force. Obviously, this force only affects objects which are moving in the rotating
reference frame.
Consider a particle of mass m free-falling under gravity in our rotating reference frame.
As before, we define Cartesian axes in the rotating frame such that the z ′ -axis points vertically upward, and the x ′ - and y ′ -axes are horizontal, with the x ′ -axis pointing directly
northward, and the y ′ -axis pointing directly westward. It follows, from Equation (7.9),
that the Cartesian equations of motion of the particle in the rotating reference frame take
the form:
ẍ ′ = 2 Ω sin λ ẏ ′ ,

(7.19)

ÿ ′ = −2 Ω sin λ ẋ ′ + 2 Ω cos λ ż ′,

(7.20)

z̈ ′ = −g − 2 Ω cos λ ẏ ′ .

(7.21)

Here, ˙ ≡ d/dt, and g is the local acceleration due to gravity. In the above, we have
neglected the centrifugal acceleration, for the sake of simplicity. This is reasonable, since
the only effect of the centrifugal acceleration is to slightly modify the magnitude and
direction of the local gravitational acceleration. We have also neglected air resistance,
which is less reasonable.
Consider a particle which is dropped (at t = 0) from rest a height h above the Earth’s
surface. The following solution method exploits the fact that the Coriolis force is much
smaller in magnitude that the force of gravity: hence, Ω can be treated as a small parameter. To lowest order (i.e., neglecting Ω), the particle’s vertical motion satisfies z̈ ′ = −g,

98

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

which can be solved, subject to the initial conditions, to give
z′ = h −

g t2
.
2

(7.22)

Substituting this expression into Equations (7.19) and (7.20), neglecting terms involving
Ω2 , and solving subject to the initial conditions, we obtain x ′ ≃ 0, and
y ′ ≃ −g Ω cos λ

t3
.
3

(7.23)

In other words, the particle is deflectedqeastward (i.e., in the negative y ′ -direction). Now,
the particle hits the ground when t ≃ 2 h/g. Hence, the net eastward deflection of the
particle as strikes the ground is
deast

Ω
cos λ
=

.

(7.24)

Note that this deflection is in the same direction as the Earth’s rotation (i.e., west to east),
and is greatest at the equator, and zero at the poles. A particle dropped from a height of
100 m at the equator is deflected by about 2.2 cm.
Consider a particle launched horizontally with some fairly large velocity
V = V0 (cos θ, − sin θ, 0).

(7.25)

Here, θ is the compass bearing of the velocity vector (so north is 0◦ , east is 90◦ , etc.).
Neglecting any vertical motion, Equations (7.19) and (7.20) yield
v̇x ′ ≃ −2 Ω V0 sin λ sin θ,

v̇y′ ≃ −2 Ω V0 sin λ cos θ,

(7.26)
(7.27)

which can be integrated to give
vx ′ ≃ V0 cos θ − 2 Ω V0 sin λ sin θ t,

vy ′ ≃ −V0 sin θ − 2 Ω V0 sin λ cos θ t.

(7.28)
(7.29)

To lowest order in Ω, the above equations are equivalent to
vx ′ ≃ V0 cos(θ + 2 Ω sin λ t),

vy ′ ≃ −V0 sin(θ + 2 Ω sin λ t).

(7.30)
(7.31)

If follows that the Coriolis force causes the compass bearing of the particle’s velocity vector
to rotate steadily as time progresses. The rotation rate is

≃ 2 Ω sin λ.

Figure 7.3: A cyclone in the northern hemisphere.
Hence, the rotation is clockwise (looking from above) in the northern hemisphere, and
counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere. The rotation rate is zero at the equator, and
greatest at the poles.
The Coriolis force has a significant effect on terrestrial weather patterns. Near equatorial regions, the intense heating of the Earth’s surface due to the Sun results in hot air
rising. In the northern hemisphere, this causes cooler air to move in a southerly direction toward the equator. The Coriolis force deflects this moving air in a clockwise sense
(looking from above), resulting in the trade winds, which blow toward the southwest. In
the southern hemisphere, the cooler air moves northward, and is deflected by the Coriolis force in a counter-clockwise sense, resulting in trade winds which blow toward the
northwest.
Furthermore, as air flows from high to low pressure regions, the Coriolis force deflects
the air in a clockwise/counter-clockwise manner in the northern/southern hemisphere,
producing cyclonic rotation—see Figure 7.3. It follows that cyclonic rotation is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. Thus, this is
the direction of rotation of tropical storms (e.g., hurricanes, typhoons) in each hemisphere.

7.5 Foucault Pendulum
Consider a pendulum consisting of a compact mass m suspended from a light cable of
length l in such a manner that the pendulum is free to oscillate in any plane whose normal
is parallel to the Earth’s surface. The mass is subject to three forces: first, the force of
gravity m g, which is directed vertically downward (we are again ignoring centrifugal
acceleration); second, the tension T in the cable, which is directed upward along the

100

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

cable; and, third, the Coriolis force. It follows that the apparent equation of motion of the
mass, in a frame of reference which co-rotates with the Earth, is [see Equation (7.9)]
m r̈ ′ = m g + T − 2 m Ω × ṙ ′ .

(7.33)

Let us define our usual Cartesian coordinates (x ′ , y ′ , z ′ ), and let the origin of our coordinate system correspond to the equilibrium position of the mass. If the pendulum cable is
deflected from the downward vertical by a small angle θ then it is easily seen that x ′ ∼ l θ,
y ′ ∼ l θ, and z ′ ∼ l θ 2 . In other words, the change in height of the mass, z ′ , is negligible compared to its horizontal displacement. Hence, we can write z ′ ≃ 0, provided that
θ ≪ 1. The tension T has the vertical component T cos θ ≃ T , and the horizontal component Thz = −T sin θ r ′ /r ′ ≃ −T r ′ /l, since sin θ ≃ r ′ /l—see Figure 7.4. Hence, the
Cartesian equations of motion of the mass are written [cf., Equations (7.19)–(7.21)]

For example, according to the above equations, the pendulum oscillates in the x ′ -direction
(i.e., north/south) at t ≃ 0, in the y ′ -direction (i.e., east/west) at t ≃ T/4, in the x ′ direction again at t ≃ T/2, etc. The precession is clockwise (looking from above) in the
northern hemisphere, and counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere.
The precession of the plane of oscillation of a pendulum, due to the Coriolis force, is
used in many museums and observatories to demonstrate that the Earth is rotating. This
method of making the Earth’s rotation manifest was first devised by Foucault in 1851.

7.6 Exercises
7.1. A pebble is dropped down an elevator shaft in the Empire State Building (h = 1250 ft,
latitude = 41◦ N). Find the pebble’s horizontal deflection (magnitude and direction) due to
the Coriolis force at the bottom of the shaft. Neglect air resistance.
7.2. If a bullet is fired due east, at an elevation angle α, from a point on the Earth whose latitude
is +λ show that it will strike the Earth with a lateral deflection 4 Ω v03 sin λ sin2 α cos α/g2 .
Is the deflection northward or southward? Here, Ω is the Earth’s angular velocity, v0 is the
bullet’s initial speed, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Neglect air resistance.
7.3. A particle is thrown vertically with initial speed v0 , reaches a maximum height, and falls back
to the ground. Show that the horizontal Coriolis deflection of the particle when it returns to
the ground is opposite in direction, and four times greater in magnitude, than the Coriolis
deflection when it is dropped at rest from the same maximum height. Neglect air resistance.
7.4. The surface of the Diskworld is a disk which rotates (counter-clockwise looking down) with
angular frequency Ω about a perpendicular axis passing through its center. Diskworld gravitational acceleration is of magnitude g, and is everywhere directed normal to the disk. A
projectile is launched from the surface of the disk at a point whose radial distance from the
axis of rotation is R. The initial velocity of the projectile (in a co-rotating frame) is of magnitude v0 , is directly radially outwards, and is inclined at an angle α to the horizontal. What
are the radial and tangential displacements of the impact point from that calculated by neglecting the centrifugal and Coriolis forces? Neglect air resistance. You may assume that the
displacements are small compared to both R and the horizontal range of the projectile.
7.5. Demonstrate that the Coriolis force causes conical pendulums to rotate clockwise and counterclockwise with slightly different angular frequencies. What is the frequency difference as a
function of terrestrial latitude?
7.6. A satellite is in a circular orbit of radius a about the Earth. Let us define a set of co-moving
Cartesian coordinates, centered on the satellite, such that the x-axis always points toward the
center of the Earth, the y-axis in the direction of the satellite’s orbital motion, and the z-axis
in the direction of the satellite’s orbital angular velocity, ω. Demonstrate that the equation
of motion of a small mass in orbit about the satellite are
ẍ = 3 ω2 x + 2 ω ẏ,
ÿ = −2 ω ẋ,

assuming that |x|/a ≪ 1 and |y|/a ≪ 1. You may neglect the gravitational attraction between
the satellite and the mass. Show that the mass executes a retrograde (i.e., in the opposite sense to the satellite’s orbital rotation) elliptical orbit about the satellite whose period
matches that of the satellite’s orbit, and whose major and minor axes are in the ratio 2 : 1,
and are aligned along the y- and x-axes, respectively.

8 Rigid Body Rotation

8.1 Introduction
This chapter examines the rotation of rigid bodies in three dimensions.

8.2 Fundamental Equations
We can think of a rigid body as a collection of a large number of small mass elements
which all maintain a fixed spatial relationship with respect to one another. Let there be N
elements, and let the ith element be of mass mi , and instantaneous position vector ri . The
equation of motion of the ith element is written
j6=i
X
d2 ri
mi 2 =
fij + Fi .
dt
j=1,N

(8.1)

Here, fij is the internal force exerted on the ith element by the jth element, and Fi the
external force acting on the ith element. The internal forces fij represent the stresses
which develop within the body in order to ensure that its various elements maintain a
constant spatial relationship with respect to one another. Of course, fij = −fji , by Newton’s
third law. The external forces represent forces which originate outside the body.
Repeating the analysis of Section 2.7, we can sum Equation (8.1) over all mass elements
to obtain
d2 rcm
= F.
(8.2)
M
dt2
P
Here, M = i=1,N mi is thePtotal mass, rcm the position vector of the center of mass [see
Equation (2.27)], and F = i=1,N Fi the total external force. It can be seen that the center
of mass of a rigid body moves under the action of the external forces like a point particle
whose mass is identical with that of the body.
Again repeating the analysis of Section 2.7, we can sum ri × Equation (8.1) over all
mass elements to obtain
dL
= T.
(8.3)
dt
P
Here, L = i=1,NP
mi ri × dri /dt is the total angular momentum of the body (about the
origin), and T = i=1,N ri × Fi the total external torque (about the origin). Note that the
above equation is only valid if the internal forces are central in nature. However, this is not
a particularly onerous constraint. Equation (8.3) describes how the angular momentum of
a rigid body evolves in time under the action of the external torques.
In the following, we shall only consider the rotational motion of rigid bodies, since
their translational motion is similar to that of point particles [see Equation (8.2)], and,
therefore, fairly straightforward in nature.

8.3 Moment of Inertia Tensor
Consider a rigid body rotating with fixed angular velocity ω about an axis which passes
through the origin—see Figure 8.1. Let ri be the position vector of the ith mass element, whose mass is mi . We expect this position vector to precess about the axis of rotation (which is parallel to ω) with angular velocity ω. It, therefore, follows from Equation (A.49) that
dri
= ω × ri .

Thus, the above equation specifies the velocity, vi = dri /dt, of each mass element as the
body rotates with fixed angular velocity ω about an axis passing through the origin.

Here, Ixx is called the moment of inertia about the x-axis, Iyy the moment of inertia about
the y-axis, Ixy the xy product of inertia, Iyz the yz product of inertia, etc. The matrix of
the Iij values is known as the moment of inertia tensor.1 Note that each component of the
moment of inertia tensor can be written as either a sum over separate mass elements, or as
an integral over infinitesimal mass elements. In the integrals, dm = ρ dV, where ρ is the
mass density, and dV a volume element. Equation (8.6) can be written more succinctly as
L = Ĩ ω.

(8.13)

Here, it is understood that L and ω are both column vectors, and Ĩ is the matrix of the Iij
values. Note that Ĩ is a real symmetric matrix: i.e., Iij∗ = Iij and Iji = Iij .
In general, the angular momentum vector, L, obtained from Equation (8.13), points in
a different direction to the angular velocity vector, ω. In other words, L is generally not
parallel to ω.
Finally, although the above results were obtained assuming a fixed angular velocity,
they remain valid at each instant in time if the angular velocity varies.

8.5 Matrix Eigenvalue Theory
It is time to review a little matrix theory. Suppose that A is a real symmetric matrix of
dimension n. If follows that A∗ = A and AT = A, where ∗ denotes a complex conjugate,
and T denotes a transpose. Consider the matrix equation
A x = λ x.

(8.19)

Any column vector x which satisfies the above equation is called an eigenvector of A. Likewise, the associated number λ is called an eigenvalue of A. Let us investigate the properties
of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix.
Equation (8.19) can be rearranged to give
(A − λ 1) x = 0,

(8.20)

where 1 is the unit matrix. The above matrix equation is essentially a set of n homogeneous
simultaneous algebraic equations for the n components of x. A well-known property of
such a set of equations is that it only has a non-trivial solution when the determinant of
the associated matrix is set to zero. Hence, a necessary condition for the above set of
equations to have a non-trivial solution is that
|A − λ 1| = 0.

(8.21)

The above formula is essentially an nth-order polynomial equation for λ. We know that
such an equation has n (possibly complex) roots. Hence, we conclude that there are n
eigenvalues, and n associated eigenvectors, of the n-dimensional matrix A.
Let us now demonstrate that the n eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the real symmetric
matrix A are all real. We have
A xi = λi xi ,
(8.22)

Rigid Body Rotation

109

and, taking the transpose and complex conjugate,
x∗i T A = λi∗ x∗i T ,

(8.23)

where xi and λi are the ith eigenvector and eigenvalue of A, respectively. Left multiplying
Equation (8.22) by x∗i T , we obtain
x∗i T A xi = λi x∗i T xi .

(8.24)

Likewise, right multiplying (8.23) by xi , we get
x∗i T A xi = λi∗ x∗i T xi .

(8.25)

The difference of the previous two equations yields
(λi − λi∗ ) x∗i T xi = 0.

(8.26)

It follows that λi = λi∗ , since x∗i T xi (which is xi∗ · xi in vector notation) is positive definite.
Hence, λi is real. It immediately follows that xi is real.
Next, let us show that two eigenvectors corresponding to two different eigenvalues are
mutually orthogonal. Let
A xi = λi xi ,

(8.27)

A xj = λj xj ,

(8.28)

where λi 6= λj . Taking the transpose of the first equation and right multiplying by xj , and
left multiplying the second equation by xTi , we obtain
xTi A xj = λi xTi xj ,

(8.29)

xTi

(8.30)

A xj =

λj xTi xj .

Taking the difference of the above two equations, we get
(λi − λj ) xTi xj = 0.

(8.31)

Since, by hypothesis, λi 6= λj , it follows that xTi xj = 0. In vector notation, this is the same
as xi · xj = 0. Hence, the eigenvectors xi and xj are mutually orthogonal.
Suppose that λi = λj = λ. In this case, we cannot conclude that xTi xj = 0 by the
above argument. However, it is easily seen that any linear combination of xi and xj is an
eigenvector of A with eigenvalue λ. Hence, it is possible to define two new eigenvectors of
A, with the eigenvalue λ, which are mutually orthogonal. For instance,
xi′ = xi ,
xj′ = xj −

(8.32)
xTi xj
xi .
xTi xi
!

(8.33)

It should be clear that this argument can be generalized to deal with any number of eigenvalues which take the same value.
In conclusion, a real symmetric n-dimensional matrix possesses n real eigenvalues, with
n associated real eigenvectors, which are, or can be chosen to be, mutually orthogonal.

8.6 Principal Axes of Rotation
We have seen that the moment of inertia tensor, Ĩ, defined in Section 8.3, takes the form
of a real symmetric three-dimensional matrix. It therefore follows, from the matrix theory
that we have just reviewed, that the moment of inertia tensor possesses three mutually
orthogonal eigenvectors which are associated with three real eigenvalues. Let the ith eigen^ i , and the ith eigenvalue
vector (which can be normalized to be a unit vector) be denoted ω
λi . It then follows that
^ i = λi ω
^ i,
Ĩ ω
(8.34)
for i = 1, 3.
^ i define the three soThe directions of the three mutually orthogonal unit vectors ω
called principal axes of rotation of the rigid body under investigation. These axes are
special because when the body rotates about one of them (i.e., when ω is parallel to one
of them) the angular momentum vector L becomes parallel to the angular velocity vector
ω. This can be seen from a comparison of Equation (8.13) and Equation (8.34).
Suppose that we reorient our Cartesian coordinate axes so the they coincide with the
mutually orthogonal principal axes of rotation. In this new reference frame, the eigenvectors of Ĩ are the unit vectors, ex , ey , and ez , and the eigenvalues are the moments of inertia
about these axes, Ixx , Iyy , and Izz , respectively. These latter quantities are referred to as
the principal moments of inertia. Note that the products of inertia are all zero in the new
reference frame. Hence, in this frame, the moment of inertia tensor takes the form of a
diagonal matrix: i.e.,


Ixx 0 0


(8.35)
Ĩ =  0 Iyy 0  .
0
0 Izz
Incidentally, it is easy to verify that ex , ey , and ez are indeed the eigenvectors of the above
matrix, with the eigenvalues Ixx , Iyy , and Izz , respectively, and that L = Ĩ ω is indeed
parallel to ω whenever ω is directed along ex , ey , or ez .
When expressed in our new coordinate system, Equation (8.13) yields
L = (Ixx ωx , Iyy ωy , Izz ωz ) ,

(8.36)

whereas Equation (8.18) reduces to
K=

Ixx ωx2 + Iyy ωy2 + Izz ωz2 .

(8.37)

In conclusion, there are many great simplifications to be had by choosing a coordinate
system whose axes coincide with the principal axes of rotation of the rigid body under
investigation. But how do we determine the directions of the principal axes in practice?
Well, in general, we have to solve the eigenvalue equation

where ω
the unit eigenvector subtends with the x-axis, β the angle it subtends with the y-axis, and
γ the angle it subtends with the z-axis. Unfortunately, the analytic solution of the above
matrix equation is generally quite difficult.
Fortunately, however, in many instances the rigid body under investigation possesses
some kind of symmetry, so that at least one principal axis can be found by inspection. In
this case, the other two principal axes can be determined as follows.
Suppose that the z-axis is known to be a principal axes (at the origin) in some coordinate system. It follows that the two products of inertia Ixz and Iyz are zero [otherwise, (0, 0, 1) would not be an eigenvector in Equation (8.39)]. The other two principal
axes must lie in the x-y plane: i.e., cos γ = 0. It then follows that cos β = sin α, since
cos2 α + cos2 β + cos2 γ = 1. The first two rows in the matrix equation (8.39) thus reduce
to
(Ixx − λ) cos α + Ixy sin α = 0,

(8.40)

Ixy cos α + (Iyy − λ) sin α = 0.

(8.41)

Eliminating λ between the above two equations, we obtain
Ixy (1 − tan2 α) = (Ixx − Iyy ) tan α.

(8.42)

But, tan(2 α) ≡ 2 tan α/(1 − tan2 α). Hence, Equation (8.42) yields
tan(2 α) =

2 Ixy
.
Ixx − Iyy

(8.43)

There are two values of α, lying between −π/2 and π/2, which satisfy the above equation.
These specify the angles, α, that the two mutually orthogonal principal axes lying in the
x-y plane make with the x-axis. Hence, we have now determined the directions of all three
principal axes. Incidentally, once we have determined the orientation angle, α, of a principal axis, we can then substitute back into Equation (8.40) to obtain the corresponding
principal moment of inertia, λ.
As an example, consider a uniform rectangular lamina of mass m and sides a and b
which lies in the x-y plane, as shown in Figure 8.2. Suppose that the axis of rotation
passes through the origin (i.e., through a corner of the lamina). Since z = 0 throughout
the lamina, it follows from Equations (8.11) and (8.12) that Ixz = Iyz = 0. Hence, the
z-axis is a principal axis. After some straightforward integration, Equations (8.7)–(8.10)
yield

The fundamental equation of motion of a rotating body [see Equation (8.3)],

is only valid in an inertial frame. However, we have seen that L is most simply expressed
in a frame of reference whose axes are aligned along the principal axes of rotation of the
body. Such a frame of reference rotates with the body, and is, therefore, non-inertial. Thus,
it is helpful to define two Cartesian coordinate systems, with the same origins. The first,
with coordinates x, y, z, is a fixed inertial frame—let us denote this the fixed frame. The
second, with coordinates x ′ , y ′ , z ′ , co-rotates with the body in such a manner that the x ′ -,

Rigid Body Rotation

113

y ′ -, and z ′ -axes are always pointing along its principal axes of rotation—we shall refer to
this as the body frame. Since the body frame co-rotates with the body, its instantaneous
angular velocity is the same as that of the body. Hence, it follows from the analysis in
Section 7.2 that
dL

Here, d/dt is the time derivative in the fixed frame, and d/dt ′ the time derivative in the
body frame. Combining Equations (8.48) and (8.49), we obtain
T=

+ ω × L.
dt ′

(8.50)

Now, in the body frame let T = (Tx ′ , Ty ′ , Tz ′ ) and ω = (ωx ′ , ωy ′ , ωz ′ ). It follows that
L = (Ix ′ x ′ ωx ′ , Iy ′ y ′ ωy ′ , Iz ′ z ′ ωz ′ ), where Ix ′ x ′ , Iy ′ y ′ and Iz ′ z ′ are the principal moments of
inertia. Hence, in the body frame, the components of Equation (8.50) yield
Tx ′ = Ix ′ x ′ ω̇x ′ − (Iy ′ y ′ − Iz ′ z ′ ) ωy ′ ωz ′ ,

(8.51)

Ty ′ = Iy ′ y ′ ω̇y ′ − (Iz ′ z ′ − Ix ′ x ′ ) ωz ′ ωx ′ ,

(8.52)

Tz ′ = Iz ′ z ′ ω̇z ′ − (Ix ′ x ′ − Iy ′ y ′ ) ωx ′ ωy ′ ,

(8.53)

where ˙ = d/dt ′ . Here, we have made use of the fact that the moments of inertia of a rigid
body are constant in time in the co-rotating body frame. The above equations are known
as Euler’s equations.
Consider a rigid body which is constrained to rotate about a fixed axis with constant
angular velocity. It follows that ω̇x ′ = ω̇y ′ = ω̇z ′ = 0. Hence, Euler’s equations, (8.51)–
(8.53), reduce to
Tx ′ = −(Iy ′ y ′ − Iz ′ z ′ ) ωy ′ ωz ′ ,

(8.54)

Ty ′ = −(Iz ′ z ′ − Ix ′ x ′ ) ωz ′ ωx ′ ,

(8.55)

Tz ′ = −(Ix ′ x ′ − Iy ′ y ′ ) ωx ′ ωy ′ .

(8.56)

These equations specify the components of the steady (in the body frame) torque exerted
on the body by the constraining supports. The steady (in the body frame) angular momentum is written
(8.57)
L = (Ix ′ x ′ ωx ′ , Iy ′ y ′ ωy ′ , Iz ′ z ′ ωz ′ ).
It is easily demonstrated that T = ω × L. Hence, the torque is perpendicular to both the
angular velocity and the angular momentum vectors. Note that if the axis of rotation is
a principal axis then two of the three components of ω are zero (in the body frame). It
follows from Equations (8.54)–(8.56) that all three components of the torque are zero.
In other words, zero external torque is required to make the body rotate steadily about a
principal axis.
Suppose that the body is freely rotating: i.e., there are no external torques. Furthermore, let the body be rotationally symmetric about the z ′ -axis. It follows that Ix ′ x ′ = Iy ′ y ′ =

− Ω ωx ′ = 0,

(8.62)

where Ω = (Ik /I⊥ − 1) ωz ′ . As is easily demonstrated, the solution to the above equations
is
ωx ′ = ω⊥ cos(Ω t ′),

ωy ′ = ω⊥ sin(Ω t ′ ),

(8.63)
(8.64)

where ω⊥ is a constant. Thus, the projection of the angular velocity vector onto the x ′ -y ′
plane has the fixed length ω⊥ , and rotates steadily about the z ′ -axis with angular velocity
Ω. It follows that the length of the angular velocity vector, ω = (ω2x ′ + ω2y ′ + ω2z ′ )1/2 , is
a constant of the motion. Clearly, the angular velocity vector makes some constant angle,
α, with the z ′ -axis, which implies that ωz ′ = ω cos α and ω⊥ = ω sin α. Hence, the
components of the angular velocity vector are

where

ωx ′ = ω sin α cos(Ω t ′ ),

We conclude that, in the body frame, the angular velocity vector precesses about the symmetry axis (i.e., the z ′ -axis) with the angular frequency Ω. Now, the components of the
angular momentum vector are
Lx ′ = I⊥ ω sin α cos(Ω t ′),

(8.69)

Ly ′ = I⊥ ω sin α sin(Ω t ′),

(8.70)

Lz ′ = Ik ω cos α.

(8.71)

Rigid Body Rotation

115

Thus, in the body frame, the angular momentum vector is also of constant length, and precesses about the symmetry axis with the angular frequency Ω. Furthermore, the angular
momentum vector makes a constant angle θ with the symmetry axis, where
tan θ =

I⊥
tan α.
Ik

(8.72)

Note that the angular momentum vector, the angular velocity vector, and the symmetry
axis all lie in the same plane: i.e., ez ′ · L × ω = 0, as can easily be verified. Moreover, the
angular momentum vector lies between the angular velocity vector and the symmetry axis
(i.e., θ < α) for a flattened (or oblate) body (i.e., I⊥ < Ik ), whereas the angular velocity
vector lies between the angular momentum vector and the symmetry axis (i.e., θ > α) for
an elongated (or prolate) body (i.e., I⊥ > Ik ).
Let us now consider the most general motion of a freely rotating asymmetric rigid body,
as seen in the body frame. Since a freely rotating body experiences no external torques,
its angular momentum vector L is a constant of the motion in the inertial fixed frame. In
general, the direction of this vector varies with time in the non-inertial body frame, but its
length remains fixed. This can be seen from Equation (8.49): if dL/dt = 0 then the scalar
product of this equation with L implies that dL2 /dt ′ = 0. It follows from Equation (8.57)
that
(8.73)
L2 = Ix2′ x ′ ωx2′ + Iy2′ y ′ ωy2′ + Iz2′ z ′ ωz2′ = constant.
The above constraint can also be derived directly from Euler’s equations, (8.51)–(8.53),
by setting Tx ′ = Ty ′ = Tz ′ = 0. A freely rotating body subject to no external torques clearly
has a constant rotational kinetic energy. Hence, from Equation (8.16),
ω · L = Ix ′ x ′ ωx2′ + Iy ′ y ′ ωy2′ + Iz ′ z ′ ωz2′ = constant.

(8.74)

This constraint can also be derived directly from Euler’s equations. We conclude that,
in the body frame, the components of ω must simultaneously satisfy the two constraints
(8.73) and (8.74). These constraints are the equations of two ellipsoids whose principal
axes coincide with the principal axes of the body, and whose principal radii are in the ratio

x ′ x ′ : Iy ′ y ′ : Iz ′ z ′ and Ix ′ x ′ : Iy ′ y ′ : Iz ′ z ′ , respectively. In general, the intersection of these
two ellipsoids is a closed curve. Hence, we conclude that the most general motion of a freely
rotating asymmetric body, as seen in the body frame, is a form of irregular precession in
which the tip of the angular velocity vector ω periodically traces out the aforementioned
closed curve. It is easily demonstrated that the tip of the angular momentum vector L
periodically traces out a different closed curve.

8.8 Eulerian Angles
We have seen how we can solve Euler’s equations to determine the properties of a rotating
body in the co-rotating body frame. Let us now investigate how we can determine the same
properties in the inertial fixed frame.

116

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

The fixed frame and the body frame share the same origin. Hence, we can transform
from one to the other by means of an appropriate rotation of our coordinate axes. In general, if we restrict ourselves to rotations about one of the Cartesian axes, three successive
rotations are required to transform the fixed frame into the body frame. There are, in fact,
many different ways to combined three successive rotations in order to achieve this. In the
following, we shall describe the most widely used method, which is due to Euler.
We start in the fixed frame, which has coordinates x, y, z, and unit vectors ex , ey , ez .
Our first rotation is counterclockwise (looking down the axis) through an angle φ about
the z-axis. The new frame has coordinates x ′′ , y ′′ , z ′′ , and unit vectors ex ′′ , ey ′′ , ez ′′ . According to Equations (A.17)–(A.19), the transformation of coordinates can be represented
as follows:

The angular velocity vector associated with φ has the magnitude φ̇, and is directed along
ez (i.e., along the axis of rotation). Hence, we can write
ωφ = φ̇ ez .

(8.76)

Clearly, φ̇ is the precession rate about the ez axis, as seen in the fixed frame.
The second rotation is counterclockwise (looking down the axis) through an angle θ
about the x ′′ -axis. The new frame has coordinates x ′′′ , y ′′′ , z ′′′ , and unit vectors ex ′′′ ,
ey ′′′ , ez ′′′ . By analogy with Equation (8.75), the transformation of coordinates can be
represented as follows:

The angular velocity vector associated with θ has the magnitude θ̇, and is directed along
ex ′′ (i.e., along the axis of rotation). Hence, we can write

The third rotation is counterclockwise (looking down the axis) through an angle ψ
about the z ′′′ -axis. The new frame is the body frame, which has coordinates x ′ , y ′ , z ′ , and
unit vectors ex ′ , ey ′ , ez ′ . The transformation of coordinates can be represented as follows:
x ′′′

The angular velocity vector associated with ψ has the magnitude ψ̇, and is directed along
ez ′′ (i.e., along the axis of rotation). Note that ez ′′′ = ez ′ , since the third rotation is about
ez ′′′ . Hence, we can write
(8.80)
ωψ = ψ̇ ez ′ .

Rigid Body Rotation

117

Clearly, ψ̇ is minus the precession rate about the ez ′ axis, as seen in the body frame.
The full transformation between the fixed frame and the body frame is rather complicated. However, the following results can easily be verified:
ez = sin ψ sin θ ex ′ + cos ψ sin θ ey ′ + cos θ ez ′ ,
ex ′′ = cos ψ ex ′ − sin ψ ey ′ .

(8.81)
(8.82)

It follows from Equation (8.81) that ez · ez ′ = cos θ. In other words, θ is the angle of
inclination between the z- and z ′ -axes. Finally, since the total angular velocity can be
written
ω = ωφ + ωθ + ωψ ,
(8.83)
Equations (8.76), (8.78), and (8.80)–(8.82) yield
ωx ′ = sin ψ sin θ φ̇ + cos ψ θ̇,

(8.84)

ωy ′ = cos ψ sin θ φ̇ − sin ψ θ̇,

(8.85)

ωz ′ = cos θ φ̇ + ψ̇.

(8.86)

The angles φ, θ, and ψ are termed Eulerian angles. Each has a clear physical interpretation: φ is the angle of precession about the ez axis in the fixed frame, ψ is minus the
angle of precession about the ez ′ axis in the body frame, and θ is the angle of inclination
between the ez and ez ′ axes. Moreover, we can express the components of the angular
velocity vector ω in the body frame entirely in terms of the Eulerian angles, and their time
derivatives [see Equations (8.84)–(8.86)].
Consider a rigid body which is constrained to rotate about a fixed axis with the constant
angular velocity ω. Let the fixed angular velocity vector point along the z-axis. In the
previous section, we saw that the angular momentum and the torque were both steady in
the body frame. Since there is no precession of quantities in the body frame, it follows that
the Eulerian angle ψ is constant. Furthermore, since the angular velocity vector is fixed in
the body frame, as well as the fixed frame [as can be seen by applying Equation (8.49) to
ω instead of L], it must subtend a constant angle with the ez ′ axis. Hence, the Eulerian
angle θ is also constant. It follows from Equations (8.84)–(8.86) that
ωx ′ = sin ψ sin θ φ̇,

(8.87)

ωy ′ = cos ψ sin θ φ̇,

(8.88)

ωz ′ = cos θ φ̇,

(8.89)

which implies that ω ≡ (ωx2′ + ωy2′ + ωz2′ )1/2 = φ̇. In other words, the precession rate, φ̇, in
the fixed frame is equal to ω. Hence, in the fixed frame, the constant torque and angular
momentum vectors found in the body frame precess about the angular velocity vector (i.e.,
about the z-axis) at the rate ω. As discussed in the previous section, for the special case
where the angular velocity vector is parallel to one of the principal axes of the body, the

118

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

angular momentum vector is parallel to the angular velocity vector, and the torque is zero.
Thus, in this case, there is no precession in the fixed frame.
Consider a rotating device such as a flywheel or a propeller. If the device is statically
balanced then its center of mass lies on the axis of rotation. This is desirable since, otherwise, gravity, which effectively acts at the center of mass, exerts a varying torque about
the axis of rotation as the device rotates, giving rise to unsteady rotation. If the device is
dynamically balanced then the axis of rotation is also a principal axis, so that, as the device
rotates its angular momentum vector, L, remains parallel to the axis of rotation. This is
desirable since, otherwise, the angular momentum vector is not parallel to the axis of rotation, and, therefore, precesses around it. Since dL/dt is equal to the torque, a precessing
torque must also be applied to the device (at right-angles to both the axis and L). The
result is a reaction on the bearings which can give rise to violent vibration and wobbling,
even when the device is statically balanced.
Consider a freely rotating body which is rotationally symmetric about one axis (the z ′ axis). In the absence of an external torque, the angular momentum vector L is a constant
of the motion [see Equation (8.3)]. Let L point along the z-axis. In the previous section,
we saw that the angular momentum vector subtends a constant angle θ with the axis of
symmetry: i.e., with the z ′ -axis. Hence, the time derivative of the Eulerian angle θ is zero.
We also saw that the angular momentum vector, the axis of symmetry, and the angular
velocity vector are coplanar. Consider an instant in time at which all of these vectors
lie in the y ′ -z ′ plane. This implies that ωx ′ = 0. According to the previous section, the
angular velocity vector subtends a constant angle α with the symmetry axis. It follows that
ωy ′ = ω sin α and ωz ′ = ω cos α. Equation (8.84) yields ψ = 0. Hence, Equation (8.85)
yields
ω sin α = sin θ φ̇.
(8.90)

(8.92)

A comparison of the above equation with Equation (8.68) gives
ψ̇ = −Ω.

(8.93)

Thus, as expected, ψ̇ is minus the precession rate (of the angular momentum and angular
velocity vectors) in the body frame. On the other hand, φ̇ is the precession rate (of the
angular velocity vector and the symmetry axis) in the fixed frame. Note that φ̇ and Ω are
quite dissimilar. For instance, Ω is negative for elongated bodies (Ik < I⊥ ) whereas φ̇ is

Rigid Body Rotation

119

positive definite. It follows that the precession is always in the same sense as Lz in the
fixed frame, whereas the precession in the body frame is in the opposite sense to Lz ′ for
elongated bodies. We found, in the previous section, that for a flattened body the angular
momentum vector lies between the angular velocity vector and the symmetry axis. This
means that, in the fixed frame, the angular velocity vector and the symmetry axis lie on
opposite sides of the fixed angular momentum vector. On the other hand, for an elongated
body we found that the angular velocity vector lies between the angular momentum vector
and the symmetry axis. This means that, in the fixed frame, the angular velocity vector
and the symmetry axis lie on the same side of the fixed angular momentum vector. (Recall
that the angular momentum vector, the angular velocity vector, and the symmetry axis, are
coplanar.)
As an example, consider the free rotation of a thin disk. It is easily demonstrated (from
the perpendicular axis theorem) that
(8.94)

Ik = 2 I⊥

for such a disk. Hence, from Equation (8.68), the precession rate in the body frame is
Ω = ω cos α.

(8.95)

According to Equation (8.91), the precession rate in the fixed frame is
h

φ̇ = ω 1 + 3 cos2 α

i1/2

.

(8.96)

In the limit in which α is small (i.e., in which the angular velocity vector is almost parallel
to the symmetry axis), we obtain
Ω ≃ ω,

φ̇ ≃ 2 ω.

(8.97)
(8.98)

Thus, the symmetry axis precesses in the fixed frame at approximately twice the angular
speed of rotation. This precession is manifest as a wobbling motion.
It is known that the axis of rotation of the Earth is very slightly inclined to its symmetry
axis (which passes through the two geographic poles). The angle α is approximately 0.2
seconds of an arc (which corresponds to a distance of about 6 m on the Earth’s surface). It
is also known that the ratio of the terrestrial moments of inertia is about Ik /I⊥ = 1.00327,
as determined from the Earth’s oblateness—see Section 12.7. Hence, from (8.68), the
precession rate of the angular velocity vector about the symmetry axis, as viewed in a
geostationary reference frame, is

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

(Of course, 2π/ω = 1 day.) The observed period of precession is about 440 days. The
disagreement between theory and observation is attributed to the fact that the Earth is
not perfectly rigid. The Earth’s symmetry axis subtends an angle θ ≃ α = 0.2 ′′ [see
(8.72)] with its angular momentum vector, but lies on the opposite side of this vector to
the angular velocity vector. This implies that, as viewed from space, the Earth’s angular
velocity vector is almost parallel to its fixed angular momentum vector, whereas its symmetry axis subtends an angle of 0.2" with both vectors, and precesses about them. The
(theoretical) precession rate of the Earth’s symmetry axis, as seen from space, is given by
Equation (8.91):
φ̇ = 1.00327 ω.

The associated precession period is

The free precession of the Earth’s symmetry axis in space, which is known as the Chandler
wobble, since it was discovered by the American astronomer Seth Chandler in 1891, is
superimposed on a much slower forced precession, with a period of about 26,000 years,
caused by the small gravitational torque exerted on the Earth by the Sun and the Moon, as
a consequence of the Earth’s slight oblateness—see Section 12.10.

8.9 Gyroscopic Precession
Let us now study the motion of a rigid rotationally symmetric top which is free to turn
about a fixed point (without friction), but which is subject to a gravitational torque—see
Figure 8.3. Suppose that the z ′ -axis coincides with the symmetry axis. Let the principal
moment of inertia about the symmetry axis be Ik , and let the other principal moments both
take the value I⊥ . Suppose that the z-axis points vertically upward, and let the common
origin, O, of the fixed and body frames coincide with the fixed point about which the top
turns. Suppose that the center of mass of the top lies a distance l along its symmetry axis
from point O, and that the mass of the top is m. Let the symmetry axis of the top subtend
an angle θ (which is an Eulerian angle) with the upward vertical.
Consider an instant in time at which the Eulerian angle ψ is zero. This implies that
the x ′ -axis is horizontal [see Equation (8.81)], as shown in the diagram. The gravitational
force, which acts at the center of mass, thus exerts a torque m g l sin θ in the x ′ -direction.
Hence, the components of the torque in the body frame are
Tx ′ = m g l sin θ,

The components of the angular velocity vector in the body frame are given by Equations (8.84)–(8.86). Thus, Euler’s equations (8.51)–(8.53) take the form:
m g l sin θ = I⊥ (θ̈ − cos θ sin θ φ̇ 2 ) + Lψ sin θ φ̇,

(8.106)

0 = I⊥ (2 cos θ θ̇ φ̇ + sin θ φ̈) − Lψ θ̇,

(8.107)

0 = L̇ψ ,

(8.108)

where
Lψ = Ik (cos θ φ̇ + ψ̇) = Ik Ω,

(8.109)

and Ω = ωz ′ is the angular velocity of the top. Multiplying Equation (8.107) by sin θ, we
obtain
L̇φ = 0,
(8.110)
where
Lφ = I⊥ sin2 θ φ̇ + Lψ cos θ.

(8.111)

According to Equations (8.108) and (8.110), the two quantities Lψ and Lφ are constants
of the motion. These two quantities are the angular momenta of the system about the z ′ and z-axis, respectively. (To be more exact, they are the generalized momenta conjugate
to the coordinates ψ and φ, respectively—see Section 9.8.) They are conserved because
the gravitational torque has no component along either the z ′ - or the z-axis. (Alternatively,
they are conserved because the Lagrangian of the top does not depend explicitly on the
coordinates ψ and θ—see Section 9.8.)
If there are no frictional forces acting on the top then the total energy, E = K + U, is
also a constant of the motion. Now,

where f(u) is a cubic polynomial. In principal, the above equation can be integrated to
give u (and, hence, θ) as a function of t:
Zu

(8.118)
t=
u0
f(u ′ )

Fortunately, we do not have to perform the above integration (which is very ugly) in
order to discuss the general properties of the solution to Equation (8.117). It is clear, from
Equation (8.118), that f(u) needs to be positive in order to obtain a physical solution.
Hence, the limits of the motion in θ are determined by the three roots of the equation
f(u) = 0. Since θ must lie between 0 and π/2, it follows that u must lie between 0 and
1. It can easily be demonstrated that f → ±∞ as u → ±∞. It can also be shown that
the largest root u3 lies in the region u3 > 1, and the two smaller roots u1 and u2 (if they
exist) lie in the region −1 ≤ u ≤ +1. It follows that, in the region −1 ≤ u ≤ 1, f(u) is
only positive between u1 and u2 . Figure 8.4 shows a case where u1 and u2 lie in the range
0 to 1. The corresponding values of θ—θ1 and θ2 , say—are then the limits of the vertical
motion. The axis of the top oscillates backward and forward between these two values of θ
as the top precesses about the vertical axis. This oscillation is called nutation. Incidentally,
if u1 becomes negative then the nutation will cause the top to strike the ground (assuming
that it is spinning on a level surface).
If there is a double root of f(u) = 0 (i.e., if u1 = u2 ) then there is no nutation, and the
top precesses steadily. However, the criterion for steady precession is most easily obtained
directly from Equation (8.106). In the absence of nutation, θ̇ = θ̈ = 0. Hence, we obtain
m g l = −I⊥ cos θ φ̇ 2 + Lψ φ̇,

8.10 Rotational Stability
Consider a rigid body for which all of the principal moments of inertia are distinct. Let
Iz ′ z ′ > Iy ′ y ′ > Ix ′ x ′ . Suppose that the body is rotating freely about one of its principal axes.
What happens when the body is slightly disturbed?

124

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

Let the body be initially rotating about the x ′ -axis, so that
ω = ωx ′ ex ′ .

(8.124)

If we apply a slight perturbation then the angular velocity becomes
ω = ωx ′ ex ′ + λ ey ′ + µ ez ′ ,

(8.125)

where λ and µ are both assumed to be small. Euler’s equations (8.51)–(8.53) take the
form
Ix ′ x ′ ω̇x ′ − (Iy ′ y ′ − Iz ′ z ′ ) λ µ = 0,

(8.126)

Iy ′ y ′ λ̇ − (Iz ′ z ′ − Ix ′ x ′ ) ωx ′ µ = 0,

(8.127)

Iz ′ z ′ µ̇ − (Ix ′ x ′ − Iy ′ y ′ ) ωx ′ λ = 0.

(8.128)

Since λ µ is second-order in small quantities—and, therefore, negligible—the first of the
above equations tells us that ωx ′ is an approximate constant of the motion. The other two
equations can be written
λ̇ =

"

#

(Iz ′ z ′ − Ix ′ x ′ ) ωx ′

Iy ′ y ′
"

(8.129)

#

(Iy ′ y ′ − Ix ′ x ′ ) ωx ′
µ̇ = −
λ.

(8.130)

Differentiating the first equation with respect to time, and then eliminating µ̇, we obtain

ωx2′ λ = 0.
λ̈ +

Iy y Iz z

(8.131)

It is easily demonstrated that µ satisfies the same differential equation. Since the term in
square brackets in the above equation is positive, the equation takes the form of a simple
harmonic equation, and, thus, has the bounded solution:
λ = λ0 cos(Ωx ′ t ′ − α).

(8.132)

Here, λ0 and α are constants of integration, and
"

(Iy ′ y ′ − Ix ′ x ′ ) (Iz ′ z ′ − Ix ′ x ′ )
Ωx ′ =
Iy ′ y ′ Iz ′ z ′

#1/2

ωx ′ .

(8.133)

Thus, the body oscillates sinusoidally about its initial state with the angular frequency Ωx ′ .
It follows that the body is stable to small perturbations when rotating about the x ′ -axis, in
the sense that the amplitude of such perturbations does not grow in time.

Rigid Body Rotation

125

Suppose that the body is initially rotating about the z ′ -axis, and is subject to a small perturbation. A similar argument to the above allows us to conclude that the body oscillates
sinusoidally about its initial state with angular frequency

(Iz ′ z ′ − Ix ′ x ′ ) (Iz ′ z ′ − Iy ′ y ′ )
Ωz ′ =
Ix ′ x ′ Iy ′ y ′

#1/2

ωz ′ .

(8.134)

Hence, the body is also stable to small perturbations when rotating about the z ′ -axis.
Suppose, finally, that the body is initially rotating about the y ′ -axis, and is subject to a
small perturbation, such that
ω = λ ex ′ + ωy ′ ey ′ + µ ez ′ .

(8.135)

It is easily demonstrated that λ satisfies the following differential equation:
#

"

(Iy ′ y ′ − Ix ′ x ′ ) (Iz ′ z ′ − Iy ′ y ′ )
ωy2′ λ = 0.
λ̈ −
Ix ′ x ′ Iz ′ z ′

(8.136)

Note that the term in square brackets is positive. Hence, the above equation is not the
simple harmonic equation. Indeed its solution takes the form
′

′

λ = A e k t + B e−k t .

(8.137)

Here, A and B are constants of integration, and
"

(Iy ′ y ′ − Ix ′ x ′ ) (Iz ′ z ′ − Iy ′ y ′ )
k=
Ix ′ x ′ Iz ′ z ′

#1/2

ωy ′ .

(8.138)

In this case, the amplitude of the perturbation grows exponentially in time. Hence, the
body is unstable to small perturbations when rotating about the y ′ -axis.
In conclusion, a rigid body with three distinct principal moments of inertia is stable to
small perturbations when rotating about the principal axes with the largest and smallest
moments, but is unstable when rotating about the axis with the intermediate moment.
Finally, if two of the principal moments are the same then it can be shown that the body
is only stable to small perturbations when rotating about the principal axis whose moment
is distinct from the other two.

9 Lagrangian Dynamics

9.1 Introduction
This chapter describes an elegant reformulation of the laws of Newtonian dynamics which
is due to the French/Italian mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange. This reformulation is
particularly useful for finding the equations of motion of complicated dynamical systems.

9.2 Generalized Coordinates
Let the qi , for i = 1, F , be a set of coordinates which uniquely specifies the instantaneous
configuration of some dynamical system. Here, it is assumed that each of the qi can vary
independently. The qi might be Cartesian coordinates, or polar coordinates, or angles,
or some mixture of all three types of coordinate, and are, therefore, termed generalized
coordinates. A dynamical system whose instantaneous configuration is fully specified by
F independent generalized coordinates is said to have F degrees of freedom. For instance,
the instantaneous position of a particle moving freely in three dimensions is completely
specified by its three Cartesian coordinates, x, y, and z. Moreover, these coordinates are
clearly independent of one another. Hence, a dynamical system consisting of a single
particle moving freely in three dimensions has three degrees of freedom. If there are two
freely moving particles then the system has six degrees of freedom, and so on.
Suppose that we have a dynamical system consisting of N particles moving freely in
three dimensions. This is an F = 3 N degree of freedom system whose instantaneous configuration can be specified by F Cartesian coordinates. Let us denote these coordinates the
xj , for j = 1, F . Thus, x1 , x2 , x3 are the Cartesian coordinates of the first particle, x4 , x5 , x6
the Cartesian coordinates of the second particle, etc. Suppose that the instantaneous configuration of the system can also be specified by F generalized coordinates, which we shall
denote the qi , for i = 1, F . Thus, the qi might be the spherical coordinates of the particles.
In general, we expect the xj to be functions of the qi . In other words,
xj = xj (q1 , q2, · · · , qF , t)

(9.1)

for j = 1, F . Here, for the sake of generality, we have included the possibility that the
functional relationship between the xj and the qi might depend on the time, t, explicitly.
This would be the case if the dynamical system were subject to time varying constraints.
For instance, a system consisting of a particle constrained to move on a surface which is
itself moving. Finally, by the chain rule, the variation of the xj due to a variation of the qi
(at constant t) is given by

Here, the fj are the Cartesian components of the forces acting on the various particles
making up the system. Thus, f1 , f2 , f3 are the components of the force acting on the first
particle, f4 , f5 , f6 the components of the force acting on the second particle, etc. Using
Equation (9.2), we can also write
δW =

Here, the Qi are termed generalized forces. Note that a generalized force does not necessarily have the dimensions of force. However, the product Qi qi must have the dimensions
of work. Thus, if a particular qi is a Cartesian coordinate then the associated Qi is a force.
Conversely, if a particular qi is an angle then the associated Qi is a torque.
Suppose that the dynamical system in question is conservative. It follows that
fj = −

According to the above analysis, if we can express the kinetic and potential energies
of our dynamical system solely in terms of our generalized coordinates and their time
derivatives then we can immediately write down the equations of motion of the system,
expressed in terms of the generalized coordinates, using Lagrange’s equation, (9.22). Unfortunately, this scheme only works for conservative systems. Let us now consider some
examples.

9.5 Motion in a Central Potential
Consider a particle of mass m moving in two dimensions in the central potential U(r).
This is clearly a two degree of freedom dynamical system. As described in Section 5.5,
the particle’s instantaneous position is most conveniently specified in terms of the plane
polar coordinates r and θ. These are our two generalized coordinates. According to Equation (5.14), the square of the particle’s velocity can be written
v2 = ṙ 2 + (r θ̇)2 .

(9.23)

Hence, the Lagrangian of the system takes the form
L=

1
m (ṙ 2 + r2 θ̇ 2 ) − U(r).

equations we derived in Chapter 5 for motion in a central potential. The advantage of
the Lagrangian method of deriving these equations is that we avoid having to express the
acceleration in terms of the generalized coordinates r and θ.

9.6 Atwood Machines
An Atwood machine consists of two weights, of mass m1 and m2 , connected by a light
inextensible cord of length l, which passes over a pulley of radius a ≪ l, and moment of
inertia I. See Figure 9.1.
Referring to the diagram, we can see that this is a one degree of freedom system whose
instantaneous configuration is specified by the coordinate x. Assuming that the cord does
not slip with respect to the pulley, the angular velocity of pulley is ẋ/a. Hence, the kinetic
energy of the system is given by

9.7 Sliding down a Sliding Plane
Consider the case of a particle of mass m sliding down a smooth inclined plane of mass M
which is, itself, free to slide on a smooth horizontal surface, as shown in Figure 9.3. This is
a two degree of freedom system, so we need two coordinates to specify the configuration.
Let us choose x, the horizontal distance of the plane from some reference point, and x ′ ,
the parallel displacement of the particle from some reference point on the plane.
Defining x- and y-axes, as shown in the diagram, the x- and y-components of the
particle’s velocity are clearly given by
vx = ẋ + ẋ ′ cos θ,

(9.46)

vy = −ẋ ′ sin θ,

(9.47)

respectively, where θ is the angle of inclination of the plane with respect to the horizontal.
Thus,
v2 = vx2 + vy2 = ẋ 2 + 2 ẋ ẋ ′ cos θ + ẋ ′ 2 .
(9.48)
Hence, the kinetic energy of the system takes the form

9.8 Generalized Momenta
Consider the motion of a single particle moving in one dimension. The kinetic energy is
K=

1
m ẋ 2 ,
2

(9.58)

where m is the mass of the particle, and x its displacement. Now, the particle’s linear
momentum is p = m ẋ. However, this can also be written
p=

∂L
∂K
=
,
∂ẋ
∂ẋ

(9.59)

since L = K − U, and the potential energy U is independent of ẋ.
Consider a dynamical system described by F generalized coordinates qi , for i = 1, F .
By analogy with the above expression, we can define generalized momenta of the form
pi =

∂L
,
∂q̇i

(9.60)

for i = 1, F . Here, pi is sometimes called the momentum conjugate to the coordinate qi .
Hence, Lagrange’s equation (9.22) can be written
dpi
∂L
=

dt
∂qi

(9.61)

136

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

for i = 1, F . Note that a generalized momentum does not necessarily have the dimensions
of linear momentum.
Suppose that the Lagrangian L does not depend explicitly on some coordinate qk . It
follows from Equation (9.61) that
∂L
dpk
= 0.
=
dt
∂qk

(9.62)

pk = const.

(9.63)

Hence,
The coordinate qk is said to be ignorable in this case. Thus, we conclude that the generalized momentum associated with an ignorable coordinate is a constant of the motion.
For example, in Section 9.5, the Lagrangian (9.24) for a particle moving in a central
potential is independent of the angular coordinate θ. Thus, θ is an ignorable coordinate,
and
∂L
pθ =
= m r2 θ̇
(9.64)
∂θ̇
is a constant of the motion. Of course, pθ is the angular momentum about the origin. This
is conserved because a central force exerts no torque about the origin.
Again, in Section 9.7, the Lagrangian (9.51) for a mass sliding down a sliding slope
is independent of the Cartesian coordinate x. It follows that x is an ignorable coordinate,
and
∂L
= M ẋ + m (ẋ + ẋ ′ cos θ)
(9.65)
px =
∂ẋ
is a constant of the motion. Of course, px is the total linear momentum in the x-direction.
This is conserved because there is no external force acting on the system in the x-direction.

9.9 Spherical Pendulum
Consider a pendulum consisting of a compact mass m on the end of light inextensible string
of length l. Suppose that the mass is free to move in any direction (as long as the string
remains taut). Let the fixed end of the string be located at the origin of our coordinate
system. We can define Cartesian coordinates, (x, y, z), such that the z-axis points vertically
upward. We can also define spherical coordinates, (r, θ, φ), whose axis points along
the −z-axis. The latter coordinates are the most convenient, since r is constrained to
always take the value l. However, the two angular coordinates, θ and φ, are free to vary
independently. Hence, this is a two degree of freedom system.
The Cartesian coordinates can be written in terms of the angular coordinates θ and φ.
In fact,
x = l sin θ cos φ,

(9.66)

y = l sin θ sin φ.

(9.67)

z = −l cos θ.

(9.68)

Lagrangian Dynamics

137

Hence, the potential energy of the system is
U = m g z = −m g l cos θ.

(9.69)

v2 = ẋ 2 + ẏ 2 + ż 2 = l2 (θ̇ 2 + sin2 θ φ̇ 2 ).

(9.70)

Also,
Thus, the Lagrangian of the system is written
L=

1
m l2 (θ̇ 2 + sin2 θ φ̇ 2 ) + m g l cos θ.
2

(9.71)

Note that the Lagrangian is independent of the angular coordinate φ. It follows that
pφ =

∂L
= m l2 sin2 θ φ̇
∂φ̇

(9.72)

is a constant of the motion. Of course, pφ is the angular momentum of the system about
the z-axis. This is conserved because neither the tension in the string nor the force of
gravity exert a torque about the z-axis. Conservation of angular momentum about the
z-axis implies that
sin2 θ φ̇ = h,
(9.73)
where h is a constant.

(9.77)

This, of course, is the equation of a simple pendulum whose motion is restricted to the
vertical plane φ = φ0 —see Section 3.10.
Suppose that θ = θ0 = const. It follows from Equation (9.73) that φ̇ = φ̇0 = const.: i.e.,
the pendulum bob rotates uniformly in a horizontal plane. According to Equations (9.73)
and (9.76),
r
g
,
(9.78)
φ̇0 =

138

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

where d = l cos θ0 is the vertical distance of the plane of rotation below the pivot point.
This type of pendulum is usually called a conical pendulum, since the string attached to the
pendulum bob sweeps out a cone as the bob rotates.
Suppose, finally, that the motion is almost conical: i.e., the value of θ remains close to
the value θ0 . Let
θ = θ0 + δθ.
(9.79)
Taylor expanding Equation (9.76) to first order in δθ, the zeroth order terms cancel out,
and we are left with
δθ̈ + φ̇02 (1 + 3 cos2 θ0 ) δθ ≃ 0.
(9.80)

Hence, solving the above equation, we obtain

θ ≃ θ0 + δθ0 cos(Ω t),
where
Ω = φ̇0

1 + 3 cos2 θ0 .

(9.81)

Thus, the angle θ executes simple harmonic motion about its mean value θ0 at the angular
frequency Ω.
Now the azimuthal angle, φ, increases by
∆φ ≃ φ̇0

π
π
=√
Ω
1 + 3 cos2 θ0

(9.83)

as the angle of inclination to the vertical, θ, goes between successive maxima and minima.
Suppose that θ0 is small. In this case, ∆φ is slightly greater than π/2. Now if ∆φ were
exactly π/2 then the pendulum bob would trace out the outline of a slightly warped circle:
i.e., something like the outline of a potato chip or a saddle. The fact that ∆φ is slightly
greater than π/2 means that this shape precesses about the z-axis in the same direction as
the direction rotation of the bob. The precession rate increases as the angle of inclination
θ0 increases. Suppose, now, that θ0 is slightly less than π/2. (Of course, θ0 can never
exceed π/2). In this case, ∆φ is slightly less than π. Now if ∆φ were exactly π then
the pendulum bob would trace out the outline of a slightly tilted circle. The fact that
∆φ is slightly less than π means that this shape precesses about the z-axis in the opposite
direction to the direction of rotation of the bob. The precession rate increases as the angle
of inclination θ0 decreases below π/2.

10.1 Introduction
This chapter investigates the application of variational principles to Newtonian dynamics.

10.2 Calculus of Variations
It is a well-known fact, first enunciated by Archimedes, that the shortest distance between
two points in a plane is a straight-line. However, suppose that we wish to demonstrate this
result from first principles. Let us consider the length, l, of various curves, y(x), which run
between two fixed points, A and B, in a plane, as illustrated in Figure 10.1. Now, l takes
the form

where y ′ ≡ dy/dx. Note that l is a function of the function y(x). In mathematics, a
function of a function is termed a functional.

Figure 10.1: Different paths between points A and B.
Now, in order to find the shortest path between points A and B, we need to minimize the
functional l with respect to small variations in the function y(x), subject to the constraint
that the end points, A and B, remain fixed. In other words, we need to solve
δl = 0.

(10.2)

The meaning of the above equation is that if y(x) → y(x) + δy(x), where δy(x) is small,
then the first-order variation in l, denoted δl, vanishes. In other words, l → l+O(δy 2 ). The

142

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

particular function y(x) for which δl = 0 obviously yields an extremum of l (i.e., either a
maximum or a minimum). Hopefully, in the case under consideration, it yields a minimum
of l.
Consider a general functional of the form

where the end points of the integration are fixed. Suppose that y(x) → y(x) + δy(x). The

Of course, y ′ = constant is the equation of a straight-line. Thus, the shortest distance
between two fixed points in a plane is indeed a straight-line.

subject to the constraint that the value of

remains constant. We can achieve our goal by finding an extremum of the new functional
K = I + λ J, where λ(x) is an undetermined function. We know that δJ = 0, since the value
of J is fixed, so if δK = 0 then δI = 0 as well. In other words, finding an extremum of K is
equivalent to finding an extremum of I. Application of the Euler-Lagrange equation yields

In principle, the above equation, together with the constraint (10.18), yields the functions
λ(x) and y(x). Incidentally, λ is generally termed a Lagrange multiplier. If F and G have no
explicit x-dependence then λ is usually a constant.
As an example, consider the following famous problem. Suppose that a uniform chain
of fixed length l is suspended by its ends from two equal-height fixed points which are a
distance a apart, where a < l. What is the equilibrium configuration of the chain?
Suppose that the chain has the uniform density per unit length ρ. Let the x- and
y-axes be horizontal and vertical, respectively, and let the two ends of the chain lie at
(±a/2, 0). The equilibrium configuration of the chain is specified by the function y(x), for
−a/2 ≤ x ≤ +a/2, where y(x) is the vertical distance of the chain below its end points at
horizontal position x. Of course, y(−a/2) = y(+a/2) = 0.
According to the discussion in Section 3.2, the stable equilibrium state of a conservative
dynamical system is one which minimizes the system’s potential energy. Now, the potential
energy of the chain is written
U = −ρ g

(10.20)

where ds = dx2 + dy2 is an element of length along the chain, and g is the acceleration
due to gravity. Hence, we need to minimize U with respect to small variations in y(x).
However, the variations in y(x) must be such as to conserve the fixed length of the chain.
Hence, our minimization procedure is subject to the constraint that
l=

It follows, from the above discussion, that we need to minimize the functional

K = U+ λl =
(−ρ g y + λ) [1 + y ′ 2 ]1/2 dx,
(10.22)
−a/2

where λ is an, as yet, undetermined constant. Since the integrand in the functional does
not depend explicitly on x, we have from Equation (10.14) that
y ′ 2 (−ρ g y + λ) [1 + y ′ 2 ]−1/2 − (−ρ g y + λ) [1 + y ′ 2 ]1/2 = k,

y(x) = −h [λ ′ + cosh(−x/h + c)].

(10.28)

The above solution contains three undetermined constants, h, λ ′ , and c. We can eliminate
two of these constants by application of the boundary conditions y(±a/2) = 0. This yields
λ ′ + cosh(∓a/2 h + c) = 0.

(10.29)

Hence, c = 0, and λ ′ = − cosh(a/2 h). It follows that
y(x) = h [cosh(a/2 h) − cosh(x/h)].

The final unknown constant, h, is determined via the application of the constraint (10.21).

10.5 Hamilton’s Principle
We saw, in Chapter 9, that we can specify the instantaneous configuration of a conservative dynamical system with F degrees of freedom in terms of F independent generalized
coordinates qi , for i = 1, F . Let K(q1 , q2 , · · · , qF , q̇1 , q̇2 , · · · , q̇F , t) and U(q1 , q2 , · · · , qF , t)
represent the kinetic and potential energies of the system, respectively, expressed in terms
of these generalized coordinates. Here, ˙ ≡ d/dt. The Lagrangian of the system is defined
L(q1 , q2 , · · · , qF , q̇1 , q̇2 , · · · , q̇F , t) = K − U.

(10.37)

Finally, the F Lagrangian equations of motion of the system take the form

(10.38)

for i = 1, F .
Note that the above equations of motion have exactly the same mathematical form as
the Euler-Lagrange equations (10.34). Indeed, it is clear, from Section 10.4, that the F
Lagrangian equations of motion (10.38) can all be derived from a single equation: namely,

In other words, the motion of the system in a given time interval is such as to maximize or
minimize the time integral of the Lagrangian, which is known as the action integral. Thus,
the laws of Newtonian dynamics can be summarized in a single statement:
The motion of a dynamical system in a given time interval is such as to maximize or minimize the action integral.
(In practice, the action integral is almost always minimized.) This statement is known as
Hamilton’s principle, and was first formulated in 1834 by the Irish mathematician William
Hamilton.

10.6 Constrained Lagrangian Dynamics
Suppose that we have a dynamical system described by two generalized coordinates, q1
and q2 . Suppose, further, that q1 and q2 are not independent variables. In other words, q1
and q2 are connected via some constraint equation of the form
f(q1 , q2 , t) = 0,

(10.40)

where f is some function of three variables. This type of constraint is called a holonomic. [A
general holonomic constraint is of the form f(q1 , q2, · · · , qF , t) = 0.] Let L(q1 , q2 , q̇1 , q̇2, t)
be the Lagrangian. How do we write the Lagrangian equations of motion of the system?
Well, according to Hamilton’s principle,

This equation must be satisfied for all possible perturbations δq1 (t), which implies that the

∂L/∂q2 − (d/dt) (∂L/∂q̇2)

∂f/∂q1

One obvious way in which we can solve this equation is to separately set both sides equal
to the same function of time, which we shall denote −λ(t). It follows that the Lagrangian

takes the form
∂f

(10.49)

Suppose, now, that we have a dynamical system described by F generalized coordinates
qi , for i = 1, F , which is subject to the holonomic constraint
f(q1 , q2 , · · · , qF , t) = 0.

A simple extension of above analysis yields following the Lagrangian equations of motion

holonomic constraints is straightforward.
Consider the following example. A cylinder of radius a rolls without slipping down a
plane inclined at an angle θ to the horizontal. Let x represent the downward displacement
of the center of mass of the cylinder parallel to the surface of the plane, and let φ represent
the angle of rotation of the cylinder about its symmetry axis. The fact that the cylinder is
rolling without slipping implies that x and φ are interrelated via the well-known constraint
Q̃i = λ(t)

f(x, φ) = x − a φ = 0.

This represents the frictional torque acting on the cylinder which forces the cylinder to

Consider a second example. A bead of mass m slides without friction on a vertical
circular hoop of radius a. Let r be the radial coordinate of the bead, and let θ be its
angular coordinate, with the lowest point on the hoop corresponding to θ = 0. Both
coordinates are measured relative to the center of the hoop. Now, the bead is constrained
to slide along the wire, which implies that
(10.62)

f(r, θ) = r − a = 0.
Note that ∂f/∂r = 1 and ∂f/∂θ = 0. The Lagrangian of the system takes the form
L=

1
m (ṙ 2 + r2 θ̇ 2 ) + m g r cos θ.

(10.63)

Hence, according to Equation (10.51), the Lagrangian equations of motion of the system
are written

(10.64)

m r2 θ̈ + m g r sin θ = 0.

10.7 Hamilton’s Equations
Consider a dynamical system with F degrees of freedom which is described by the generalized coordinates qi , for i = 1, F . Suppose that neither the kinetic energy, K, nor the
potential energy, U, depend explicitly on the time, t. Now, in conventional dynamical systems, the potential energy is generally independent of the q̇i , whereas the kinetic energy
takes the form of a homogeneous quadratic function of the q̇i . In other words,
K=

If all of the conditions discussed above are satisfied then Equations (10.71) and (10.72)
yield
H = K + U.
(10.74)
In other words, the function H is equal to the total energy of the system.
Consider the variation of the function H. We have

The first and third terms in the bracket cancel, because pi = ∂L/∂q̇i . Furthermore, since
Lagrange’s equation can be written ṗi = ∂L/∂qi (see Section 9.8), we obtain
δH =

Suppose, now, that we can express the total energy of the system, H, solely as a function of
the qi and the pi , with no explicit dependence on the q̇i . In other words, suppose that we

can write H = H(qi , pi ). When the energy is written in this fashion it is generally termed
the Hamiltonian of the system. The variation of the Hamiltonian function takes the form

form of F second-order differential equations.
Consider a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The kinetic and potential energies of
the system are written K = (1/2) m ẋ 2 and U = (1/2) k x2 , where x is the displacement, m
the mass, and k > 0. The generalized momentum conjugate to x is

11 Coupled Oscillations

11.1 Introduction
This chapter examines the motion of a many degree of freedom dynamical system which
is perturbed from some equilibrium state.

11.2 Equilibrium State
Consider an F degree of freedom dynamical system described by the generalized coordinates qi , for i = 1, F . Suppose that the kinetic energy K and the potential energy U are
not explicit functions of time. This implies that the system in question is isolated: i.e., it
is not subject to any external forces or time-varying constraints. In virtually all dynamical
systems of interest, the kinetic energy can be expressed as a quadratic form: i.e.,
1 X
K=
mij (q1 , q2 , · · · , qF ) q̇i q̇j .
(11.1)
2 i,j=1,F
Without loss of generality, we can specify that the weights mij in the above form are
invariant under interchange of the indices i and j: i.e.,
mij = mji .

(11.2)

Finally, the potential energy is written U = U(q1 , q2 , · · · , qF ).
Suppose that qi = qi 0 , for i = 1, F , corresponds to an equilibrium state of the system.
It follows that qi = qi 0 and q̇i = q̈i = 0, for i = 1, F , should be a possible solution of the
equations of motion. Now, Lagrange’s equations of motion for the system take the form
[see Equation (9.22)]

for i = 1, F . Here, we have made use of the definition L = K − U, and the fact that U is
independent of the q̇i . Now, it is clear, from an examination of Equation (11.1), that every
component making up the first two terms in the above equation contains either a q̇j or a
q̈j , for some j. But, we can set all of the generalized velocities and accelerations to zero
in an equilibrium state of the system. Hence, the first two terms in the above equation are
zero, and the condition for equilibrium reduces to
Qi 0 = −

∂U(q1 0 , q2 0 , · · · , qF 0 )
= 0,
∂qi

(11.4)

for i = 1, F . In other words, qi = qi 0 , for i = 1, F , is an equilibrium state provided that all
of the generalized forces, Qi [see Equation (9.8)], evaluated at qi = qi 0 , are zero. Let us
suppose that this is the case.

156

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

11.3 Stability Equations
It is evident that if our system is initialized in some equilibrium state, with all of the q̇i set
to zero, then it will remain in this state for ever. But what happens if the system is slightly
perturbed from the equilibrium state?
Let
qi = qi 0 + δqi ,
(11.5)
for i = 1, F , where the δqi are small. To lowest order in δqi , the kinetic energy (11.1) can
be written
1 X
K≃
Mij δq̇i δq̇j ,
(11.6)
2 i,j=1,F
where

Mij = mij (q1 0 , q2 0 , · · · , qF 0 ),

(11.7)

Mij = Mji .

(11.8)

and
Note that the weights Mij in the quadratic form (11.6) are now constants.
Taylor expanding the potential energy function about the equilibrium state, up to
second-order in the δqi , we obtain
U ≃ U0 −

X

Qi 0 δqi −

i=1,F

1 X
Gij δqi δqj ,
2 i,j=1,F

(11.9)

where U0 = U(q1 0 , q2 0 , · · · , qF 0 ), the Qi 0 are specified in Equation (11.4), and
Gij = −

∂2 U(q1 0 , q2 0 , · · · , qF 0 )
.
∂qi ∂qj

(11.10)

Now, we can set U0 to zero without loss of generality. Moreover, according to Equation (11.4), the Qi 0 are all zero. Hence, the expression (11.9) reduces to
U≃−

1 X
Gij δqi δqj .
2 i,j=1,F

(11.11)

Note that, since ∂2 U/∂qi ∂qj ≡ ∂2 U/∂qj ∂qi , the constants weights Gij in the above quadratic
form are invariant under interchange of the indices i and j: i.e.,
Gij = Gji .

(11.12)

With K and U specified by the quadratic forms (11.6) and (11.11), respectively, Lagrange’s equations of motion (11.3) reduce to
X
(Mij δq̈j − Gij δqj ) = 0,
(11.13)
j=1,F

Coupled Oscillations

157

for i = 1, F . Note that the above coupled differential equations are linear in the δqi .
It follows that the solutions are superposable. Let us search for solutions of the above
equations in which all of the perturbed coordinates δqi have a common time variation of
the form
δqi (t) = δqi e γ t ,
(11.14)
for i = 1, F . Now, Equations (11.13) are a set of F second-order differential equations.
Hence, the most general solution contains 2F arbitrary constants of integration. Thus, if
we can find sufficient independent solutions of the form (11.14) to Equations (11.13) that
the superposition of these solutions contains 2F arbitrary constants then we can be sure
that we have found the most general solution. Equations (11.13) and (11.14) yield
X
(Gij − γ2 Mij ) δqj = 0,
(11.15)
j=1,F

which can be written more succinctly as a matrix equation:
(G − γ2 M) δq = 0.

(11.16)

Here, G is the real [see Equation (11.10)] symmetric [see Equation (11.12)] F × F matrix of the Gij values. Furthermore, M is the real [see Equation (11.1)] symmetric [see
Equation (11.8)] F × F matrix of the Mij values. Finally, δq is the 1 × F vector of the δqi
values, and 0 is a null vector.

11.4 More Matrix Eigenvalue Theory
Equation (11.16) takes the form of a matrix eigenvalue equation:
(G − λ M) x = 0.

(11.17)

Here, G and M are both real symmetric matrices, whereas λ is termed the eigenvalue, and
x the associated eigenvector. The above matrix equation is essentially a set of F homogeneous simultaneous algebraic equations for the components of x. As is well-known, a
necessary condition for such a set of equations to possess a non-trivial solution is that the
determinant of the matrix must be zero: i.e.,
|G − λ M| = 0.

(11.18)

The above formula reduces to an F th-order polynomial equation for λ. Hence, we conclude
that Equation (11.17) is satisfied by F eigenvalues, and F associated eigenvectors.
We can easily demonstrate that the eigenvalues are all real. Suppose that λk and xk are
the kth eigenvalue and eigenvector, respectively. Then we have
G xk = λk M xk .

(11.19)

158

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

Taking the transpose and complex conjugate of the above equation, and right multiplying
by xk , we obtain
x∗k T G∗ T xk = λ∗k x∗k T M∗ T xk .
(11.20)
Here, T denotes a transpose, and ∗ a complex conjugate. However, since G and M are
both real symmetric matrices, it follows that G∗ T = G and M∗ T = M. Hence,
x∗k T G xk = λ∗k x∗k T M xk .

(11.21)

Next, left multiplying Equation (11.19) by x∗k T , we obtain
x∗k T G xk = λk x∗k T M xk .

(11.22)

Taking the difference between the above two expressions, we get
(λ∗k − λk ) x∗k T M xk = 0.

(11.23)

Since x∗k T M xk is not generally zero, except in the trivial case where xk is a null vector, we
conclude that λ∗k = λk for all k. In other words, the eigenvalues are all real. It immediately
follows that the eigenvectors can also be chosen to be all real.
Consider two distinct eigenvalues, λk and λl , with the associated eigenvectors xk and
xl , respectively. We have
G xk = λk M xk ,

(11.24)

G xl = λl M xl .

(11.25)

Right multiplying the transpose of Equation (11.24) by xl , and left multiplying Equation
(11.25) by xTk , we obtain
xTk G xl = λk xTk M xl,

(11.26)

xTk G xl = λl xTk M xl .

(11.27)

Taking the difference between the above two expressions, we get
(λk − λl ) xTk M xl = 0.

(11.28)

xTk M xl = 0,

(11.29)

Hence, we conclude that
provided λk 6= λl . In other words, two eigenvectors corresponding to two different eigenvalues are “orthogonal” to one another (in the sense specified in the above equation).
Moreover, it is easily demonstrated that different eigenvectors corresponding to the same
eigenvalue can be chosen in such a manner that they are also orthogonal to one another—
see Section 8.5. Thus, we conclude that all of the eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal.
Since Equation (11.17) only specifies the directions, and not the lengths, of the eigenvectors, we are free to normalize our eigenvectors such that
xTk M xl = δkl ,

(11.30)

Coupled Oscillations

159

where δkl = 1 when k = l, and δkl = 0 otherwise. Note, finally, that since the xk , for
k = 1, F , are mutually orthogonal, they are independent (i.e., one eigenvector cannot
be expressed as a linear combination of the others), and completely span F -dimensional
vector space.

11.5 Normal Modes
It follows from Equation (11.14) and (11.15), plus the mathematical results contained in
the previous section, that the most general solution to Equation (11.13) can be written
X
δqk (t),
(11.31)
δq(t) =
k=1,F

where

√



δqk (t) = αk e+



xk .

(11.32)

Here, the λk and the xk are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained by solving Equation (11.17). Moreover, the αk and βk are arbitrary
√ constants. Finally, we have made use
of the fact that the two roots of γ2 = λk are γ = ± λk .
According to Equation (11.31), the most general perturbed motion of the system consists of a linear combination of F different modes. These modes are generally termed
normal modes, since they are mutually orthogonal (because the xk are mutually orthogonal). Furthermore, it follows from the independence of the xk that the normal modes
are also independent (i.e., one mode cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the
others). The kth normal mode has a specific pattern of motion which is specified by the
kth eigenvector, xk . Moreover, the kth mode has a specific time variation which is determined by the associated eigenvalue, λk . Recall that λk is real. Hence, there are only two
possibilities. Either λk is positive, in which case we can write




δqk (t) = αk e+γk t + βk e−γk t xk ,

(11.33)

where λk = γk2 , or λk is negative, in which case we can write




δqk (t) = αk e+i ωk t + βk e−i ωk t xk ,

(11.34)

where λk = −ωk2 . In other words, if λk is positive then the kth normal mode grows or
decays secularly in time, whereas if λk is negative then the kth normal mode oscillates in
time. Obviously, if the system possesses one or more normal modes which grow secularly
in time then the equilibrium about which we originally expanded the equations of motion
must be an unstable equilibrium. On the other hand, if all of the normal modes oscillate in
time then the equilibrium is stable. Thus, we conclude that whilst Equation (11.4) is the
condition for the existence of an equilibrium state in a many degree of freedom system,
the condition for the equilibrium to be stable is that all of the eigenvalues of the stability
equation (11.17) must be negative.

160

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

The arbitrary constants αk and βk appearing in expression (11.32) are determined
from the initial conditions. Thus, if δq(0) = δq(t = 0) and δq̇(0) = δq̇(t = 0) then it is easily
demonstrated from Equations (11.30)–(11.32) that
xTk M δq(0) = αk + βk ,

(11.35)

(11.36)

and
xTk M δq̇(0) =

λk (αk − βk ).

(11.37)
(11.38)

Note, finally, that since there are 2F arbitrary constants (two for each of the F normal
modes), we can be sure that Equation (11.31) represents the most general solution to
Equation (11.13).

11.6 Normal Coordinates
Since the eigenvectors xk , for k = 1, F , span F -dimensional vector space, we can always
write the displacement vector δq as some linear combination of the xk : i.e.,
δq(t) =

X

ηk (t) xk .

(11.39)

k=1,F

We can regard the ηk (t) as a new set of generalized coordinates, since specifying the ηk is
equivalent to specifying the δqk (and, hence, the qk ). The ηk are usually termed normal
coordinates. According to Equations (11.30) and (11.39), the normal coordinates can be
written in terms of the δqk as
ηk = xTk M δq.
(11.40)
Let us now try to express K, U, and the equations of motion in terms of the ηk .
The kinetic energy can be written
K=

1 T
δq̇ M δq̇,
2

(11.41)

where use has been made of Equation (11.6). It follows from (11.39) that
K=

1 X
η̇k η̇l xTk M xl .
2 k,l=1,F

(11.42)

Coupled Oscillations

161

Finally, making use of the orthonormality condition (11.30), we obtain
K=

1 X 2
η̇ .
2 k=1,F k

(11.43)

Hence, the kinetic energy K takes the form of a diagonal quadratic form when expressed
in terms of the normal coordinates.
The potential energy can be written
1
U = − δqT G δq,
2

(11.44)

where use has been made of Equations (11.11). It follows from (11.39) that
U=−

1 X
ηk ηl xTk G xl .
2 k,l=1,F

(11.45)

Finally, making use of Equation (11.19) and the orthonormality condition (11.30), we
obtain
1 X
λk ηk2 .
(11.46)
U=−
2 k=1,F

Hence, the potential energy U also takes the form of a diagonal quadratic form when
expressed in terms of the normal coordinates.
Writing Lagrange’s equations of motion in terms of the normal coordinates, we obtain
[cf., Equation (11.3)]

∂K
∂U

(11.47)

for k = 1, F . Thus, it follows from Equations (11.43) and (11.46) that
(11.48)

η̈k = λk ηk ,

for k = 1, F . In other words, Lagrange’s equations reduce to a set of F uncoupled simple
harmonic equations when expressed in terms of the normal coordinates. The solutions to
the above equations are obvious: i.e.,
√

ηk (t) = αk e+

λk t

√

+ βk e −

λk t

,

(11.49)

where αk and βk are arbitrary constants. Hence, it is clear from Equations (11.39) and
(11.49) that the most general solution to the perturbed equations of motion is indeed
given by Equations (11.31) and (11.32).
In conclusion, the equations of motion of a many degree of freedom dynamical system which is slightly perturbed from an equilibrium state take a particularly simple form
when expressed in terms of the normal coordinates. Each normal coordinate specifies the
instantaneous displacement of an independent mode of oscillation (or secular growth) of
the system. Moreover, each normal coordinate oscillates at a characteristic frequency (or
grows at a characteristic rate), and is completely unaffected by the other coordinates.

11.7 Spring-Coupled Masses
Consider the two degree of freedom dynamical system pictured in Figure 11.1. In this
system, two point objects of mass m are free to move in one dimension. Furthermore, the
masses are connected together by a spring of spring constant k, and are also each attached
to fixed supports via springs of spring constant k ′ .
Let q1 and q2 be the displacements of the first and second masses, respectively, from the
equilibrium state. It follows that the extensions of the left-hand, middle, and right-hand
springs are q1 , q2 − q1 , and −q2 , respectively. The kinetic energy of the system takes the
form

Moreover, Equations (11.30) and (11.53) yield the following normalization condition for
the eigenvectors:

(11.64)
for k = 1, 2. It follows that the two eigenvectors are
x1 = (2 m)−1/2 (1, 1),

(11.65)

x2 = (2 m)−1/2 (1, −1).

(11.66)

According to Equations (11.61)–(11.62) and (11.65)–(11.66), our two degree of freedom system possesses two normal modes. The first mode oscillates at the frequency ω1 ,
and is a purely symmetric mode: i.e., q1 = q2 . Note that such a mode does not stretch
the middle spring. Hence, ω1 is independent of k. In fact, ω1 is simply the characteristic
oscillation frequency of a mass m on the end of a spring of spring constant k ′ . The second
mode oscillates at the frequency ω2 , and is a purely anti-symmetric mode: i.e., q1 = −q2 .
Since such a mode stretches the middle spring, the second mode experiences a greater
restoring force than the first, and hence has a higher oscillation frequency: i.e., ω2 > ω1 .

11.8 Triatomic Molecule
Consider the simple model of a linear triatomic molecule (e.g., carbon dioxide) illustrated
in Figure 11.2. The molecule consists of a central atom of mass M flanked by two identical
atoms of mass m. The atomic bonds are represented as springs of spring constant k. The
linear displacements of the flanking atoms are q1 and q2 , whilst that of the central atom is
q3 . Let us investigate the linear modes of oscillation our model molecule.

(11.72)

Clearly, we have a three degree of freedom dynamical system. However, we can reduce
this to a two degree of freedom system by only considering oscillatory modes of motion,

Coupled Oscillations

and, hence, neglecting translational modes. We can achieve this by demanding that the
center of mass of the system remains stationary. In other words, we require that
(11.73)

m (q1 + q2 ) + M q3 = 0.
This constraint can be rearranged to give
q3 = −

(q1 + q2 ).

Now, the equation of motion of the system takes the form [see Equation (11.17)]
(G − λ M) x = 0,

(11.79)

where x is the column vector of the q1 and q2 values. The solubility condition for the above
equation is

(11.80)

x2 = (2 m)−1/2 (1 + 2 α)−1/2 (1, 1).

(11.87)

Thus, we conclude from Equations (11.74) and (11.84)–(11.87) that our model molecule
possesses two normal modes of oscillation. The first mode oscillates at the frequency ω1 ,
and is an anti-symmetric mode in which q1 = −q2 and q3 = 0. In other words, in this mode
of oscillation, the two end atoms move in opposite directions whilst the central atom remains stationary. The second mode oscillates at the frequency ω2 , and is a mixed symmetry
mode in which q1 = q2 but q3 = −2 α q1 . In other words, in this mode of oscillation, the
two end atoms move in the same direction whilst the central atom moves in the opposite
direction.
Finally, it is easily demonstrated that the normal coordinates of the system are

12 Gravitational Potential Theory

12.1 Introduction
This chapter employs gravitational potential theory in combination with Newtonian dynamics to examine various interesting phenomena in the Solar System.

12.2 Gravitational Potential
Consider two point masses, m and m ′ , located at position vectors r and r ′ , respectively.
According to Section 5.3, the acceleration g of mass m due to the gravitational force
exerted on it by mass m ′ takes the form
g = G m′

(r ′ − r)
.
|r ′ − r| 3

(12.1)

Now, the x-component of this acceleration is written
gx = G m ′

(x ′ − x)
,
[(x ′ − x)2 + (y ′ − y)2 + (z ′ − z)2 ] 3/2

(12.2)

where r = (x, y, z) and r ′ = (x ′ , y ′ , z ′ ). However, as is easily demonstrated,

where

(12.5)

(12.6)

is termed the gravitational potential. Of course, we can only write g in the form (12.5)
because gravity is a conservative force—see Chapter 2. Note that gravitational potential,
Φ, is directly related to gravitational potential energy, U. In fact, the potential energy of
mass m is U = m Φ.

170

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

Now, it is well-known that gravity is a superposable force. In other words, the gravitational force exerted on some test mass by a collection of point masses is simply the sum of
the forces exerted on the test mass by each point mass taken in isolation. It follows that
the gravitational potential generated by a collection of point masses at a certain location
in space is the sum of the potentials generated at that location by each point mass taken
in isolation. Hence, using Equation (12.6), if there are N point masses, mi (for i = 1, N),
located at position vectors ri , then the gravitational potential generated at position vector
r is simply
X mi
Φ(r) = −G
.
(12.7)
|r

i=1,N
Suppose, finally, that, instead of having a collection of point masses, we have a continuous mass distribution. In other words, let the mass at position vector r ′ be ρ(r ′) d3 r ′ ,
where ρ(r ′) is the local mass density, and d3 r ′ a volume element. Summing over all space,
and taking the limit d3 r ′ → 0, Equation (12.7) yields
Z
ρ(r ′) 3 ′
dr,
(12.8)
Φ(r) = −G
|r ′ − r|

where the integral is taken over all space. This is the general expression for the gravitational potential, Φ(r), generated by a continuous mass distribution, ρ(r).

12.3 Axially Symmetric Mass Distributions
At this point, it is convenient to adopt standard spherical coordinates, (r, θ, φ), aligned
along the z-axis. These coordinates are related to regular Cartesian coordinates as follows
(see Section A.17):
x = r sin θ cos φ,

(12.9)

y = r sin θ sin φ,

(12.10)

z = r cos θ.

(12.11)

Consider an axially symmetric mass distribution: i.e., a ρ(r) which is independent of the
azimuthal angle, φ. We would expect such a mass distribution to generated an axially symmetric gravitational potential, Φ(r, θ). Hence, without loss of generality, we can set φ = 0
when evaluating Φ from Equation (12.8). In fact, given that d3 r ′ = r ′ 2 sin θ ′ dr ′ dθ ′ dφ ′
in spherical coordinates, this equation yields
Z ∞ Z π Z 2π ′ 2

(12.14)

and

r · r ′ = r r ′ F,

Likewise, any well-behaved (even) function of θ can be represented as a weighted sum of
the Pn (cos θ).

12.4 Potential Due to a Uniform Sphere

According to Equation (12.38), the gravitational potential outside a uniform sphere of
mass M is the same as that generated by a point mass M located at the sphere’s center. It
turns out that this is a general result for any finite spherically symmetric mass distribution.
Indeed, from the previous analysis, it is clear that ρ(r) = ρ0 (r) and Φ(r) = Φ0 (r) for a
spherically symmetric mass distribution. Suppose that the mass distribution extends out
to r = a. It immediately follows, from Equation (12.33), that

laws of motion, in their primitive form, apply not only to point masses, but also to extended
spherically symmetric masses. In fact, this is something which we have implicitly assumed
all along in this book.
According to Equation (12.37), the gravitational potential inside a uniform sphere is
quadratic in r. This implies that if a narrow shaft were drilled though the center of the
sphere then a test mass, m, moving in this shaft would experience a gravitational force
acting toward the center which scales linearly in r. In fact, the force in question is given

12.5 Potential Outside a Uniform Spheroid
Let us now calculate the gravitational potential generated outside a spheroid of uniform
mass density γ and mean radius a. A spheroid is the solid body produced by rotating an
ellipse about a major or minor axis. Let the axis of rotation coincide with the z-axis, and
let the outer boundary of the spheroid satisfy

r = aθ (θ) = a 1 − ǫ P2 (cos θ) ,

(12.41)

where ǫ is the termed the ellipticity. Here, we are assuming that |ǫ| ≪ 1, so that the
spheroid is very close to being a sphere. If ǫ > 0 then the spheroid is slightly squashed
along its symmetry axis, and is termed oblate. Likewise, if ǫ < 0 then the spheroid is
slightly elongated along its axis, and is termed prolate—see Figure 12.1. Of course, if
ǫ = 0 then the spheroid reduces to a sphere.
Now, according to Equation (12.29) and (12.30), the gravitational potential generated
outside an axially symmetric mass distribution can be written

(12.51)

where use has been made of Equation (12.41).
Consider a self-gravitating spheroid of mass M, mean radius a, and ellipticity ǫ: e.g.,
a star, or a planet. Assuming, for the sake of simplicity, that the spheroid is composed of
uniform density incompressible fluid, the gravitational potential on its surface is given by
Equation (12.51). However, the condition for an equilibrium state is that the potential be

176

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

constant over the surface. If this is not the case then there will be gravitational forces acting tangential to the surface. Such forces cannot be balanced by internal pressure, which
only acts normal to the surface. Hence, from (12.51), it is clear that the condition for equilibrium is ǫ = 0. In other words, the equilibrium configuration of a self-gravitating mass
is a sphere. Deviations from this configuration can only be caused by forces in addition to
self-gravity and internal pressure: e.g., centrifugal forces due to rotation, or tidal forces
due to orbiting masses.

12.6 Rotational Flattening
Let us consider the equilibrium configuration of a self-gravitating spheroid, composed of
uniform density incompressible fluid, which is rotating steadily about some fixed axis. Let
M be the total mass, a the mean radius, ǫ the ellipticity, and Ω the angular velocity of
rotation. Furthermore, let the axis of rotation coincide with the axis of symmetry, which is
assumed to run along the z-axis.
Let us transform to a non-inertial frame of reference which co-rotates with the spheroid
about the z-axis, and in which the spheroid consequently appears to be stationary. From
Chapter 7, the problem is now analogous to that of a non-rotating spheroid, except that
the surface acceleration is written g = gg + gc , where gg = −∇Φ(r, θ) is the gravitational
acceleration, and gc the centrifugal acceleration. The latter acceleration is of magnitude
r sin θ Ω2 , and is everywhere directed away from the axis of rotation (see Figure 12.2 and
Chapter 7). The acceleration thus has components
gc = r Ω2 sin θ (sin θ, cos θ, 0)

(12.52)

in spherical polar coordinates. It follows that gc = −∇χ, where
χ(r, θ) = −

Ω2 r2

sin2 θ = −

3

(12.53)

can be thought of as a sort of centrifugal potential. Hence, the total surface acceleration is
g = −∇(Φ + χ).

(12.54)

As before, the criterion for an equilibrium state is that the surface lie at a constant total
potential, so as to eliminate tangential surface forces which cannot be balanced by internal
pressure. Hence, assuming that the surface satisfies Equation (12.41), the equilibrium
configuration is specified by
Φ(aθ , θ) + χ(aθ , θ) = c,
(12.55)
where c is a constant. It follows from Equations (12.51) and (12.53) that, to first-order in
ǫ and Ω2 ,

which yields

(12.57)
4 GM
We conclude, from the above expression, that the equilibrium configuration of a (relatively slowly) rotating self-gravitating mass distribution is an oblate spheroid: i.e., a sphere
which is slightly flattened along its axis of rotation. The degree of flattening is proportional
to the square of the rotation rate. Now, from (12.41), the mean radius of the spheroid is
a, the radius at the poles (i.e., along the axis of rotation) is ap = a (1 − 2 ǫ/3), and the
radius at the equator (i.e., perpendicular to the axis of rotation) is ae = a (1 + ǫ/3)—see
Figure 12.2. Hence, the degree of rotational flattening can be written
ǫ=

ae − ap
5 Ω2 a3
=ǫ=

4 GM

(12.58)

Now, for the Earth, a = 6.37 × 106 m, Ω = 7.27 × 10−5 rad./s, and M = 5.97 × 1024 kg.
Thus, we predict that
ǫ = 0.00429,
(12.59)
corresponding to a difference between equatorial and polar radii of
∆a = ae − ap = ǫ a = 27.3 km.

(12.60)

In fact, the observed degree of flattening of the Earth is ǫ = 0.00335, corresponding to
a difference between equatorial and polar radii of 21.4 km. The main reason that our
analysis has overestimated the degree of rotational flattening of the Earth is that it models
the terrestrial interior as a uniform density incompressible fluid. In reality, the Earth’s core
is much denser than its crust (see Exercise 12.1).
For Jupiter, a = 6.92 × 107 m, Ω = 1.76 × 10−4 rad./s, and M = 1.90 × 1027 kg. Hence,
we predict that
ǫ = 0.101.
(12.61)

178

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

Note that this degree of flattening is much larger than that of the Earth, due to Jupiter’s
relatively large radius (about 10 times that of Earth), combined with its relatively short
rotation period (about 0.4 days). In fact, the polar flattening of Jupiter is clearly apparent
from images of this planet. The observed degree of polar flattening of Jupiter is actually
ǫ = 0.065. Our estimate of ǫ is probably slightly too large because Jupiter, which is mostly
gaseous, has a mass distribution which is strongly concentrated at its core (see Exercise
12.1).

density γ then its ellipticity is given by

(12.65)

This result, which is known as McCullough’s formula, demonstrates that the Earth’s ellipticity is directly related to the difference between its principle moments of inertia. It turns
out that McCullough’s formula holds for any axially symmetric mass distribution, and not
just a spheroidal distribution with uniform density. Finally, McCullough’s formula can be
combined with Equation (12.49) to give

This is the general expression for the gravitational potential generated outside an axially
symmetric mass distribution. The first term on the right-hand side is the monopole gravitational field which would be generated if all of the mass in the distribution were concentrated at its center of mass, whereas the second term is the quadrupole field generated by
any deviation from spherical symmetry in the distribution.

12.8 Tidal Elongation
Consider two point masses, m and m ′ , executing circular orbits about their common center
of mass, C, with angular velocity ω. Let R be the distance between the masses, and ρ the

Let us transform to a non-inertial frame of reference which rotates, about an axis perpendicular to the orbital plane and passing through C, at the angular velocity ω. In this
reference frame, both masses appear to be stationary. Consider mass m. In the rotating
frame, this mass experiences a gravitational acceleration

directed away from the center of mass. However, it is easily demonstrated, using Equations (12.67) and (12.68), that
ac = ag .
(12.71)
In other words, the gravitational and centrifugal accelerations balance, as must be the case
if mass m is to remain stationary in the rotating frame. Let us investigate how this balance
is affected if the masses m and m ′ have finite spatial extents.

gravitational accelerations at some point D in the vicinity of point B. It is convenient to
adopt spherical coordinates, centered on point B, and aligned such that the z-axis coincides
with the line BA.
Let us assume that the mass distribution m is orbiting around C, but is not rotating
about an axis passing through its center, in order to exclude rotational flattening from
our analysis. If this is the case then it is easily seen that each constituent point of m
executes circular motion of angular velocity ω and radius ρ—see Figure 12.5. Hence, each
constituent point experiences the same centrifugal acceleration: i.e.,

of the balance between the centrifugal and gravitational accelerations in the equivalent
point mass problem discussed above. However, this balance is only exact at the center
of the mass distribution m. Away from the center, the centrifugal acceleration remains
constant, whereas the gravitational acceleration increases with increasing z. Hence, at
positive z, the gravitational acceleration is larger than the centrifugal, giving rise to a
net acceleration in the +z-direction. Likewise, at negative z, the centrifugal acceleration
is larger than the gravitational, giving rise to a net acceleration in the −z-direction. It
follows that the mass distribution m is subject to a residual acceleration, represented by
the second-order variation in Equation (12.82), which acts to elongate it along the z-axis.
This effect is known as tidal elongation.
In order to calculate the tidal elongation of the mass distribution m we need to add the
potential, χ + Φ ′ , due to the external forces, to the gravitational potential, Φ, generated
by the distribution itself. Assuming that the mass distribution is spheroidal with mass m,
mean radius a, and ellipticity ǫ, it follows from Equations (12.41), (12.51), and (12.82)
that the total surface potential is given by

Consider the tidal elongation of the Earth due to the Moon. In this case, we have
a = 6.37 × 106 m, R = 3.84 × 108 m, m = 5.97 × 1024 kg, and m ′ = 7.35 × 1022 kg. Hence,
we calculate that −ǫ = 2.1 × 10−7 , or
∆a = a+ − a− = −ǫ a = 1.34 m.

(12.86)

We, thus, predict that tidal forces due to the Moon cause the Earth to elongate along the
axis joining its center to the Moon by about 1.3 meters. Since water is obviously more fluid
than rock (especially on relatively short time-scales) most of this elongation takes place in
the oceans rather than in the underlying land. Hence, the oceans rise, relative to the land,
in the region of the Earth closest to the Moon, and also in the region furthest away. Since
the Earth is rotating, whilst the tidal bulge of the oceans remains relatively stationary, the
Moon’s tidal force causes the ocean at a given point on the Earth’s surface to rise and fall,
by about a meter, twice daily, giving rise to the phenomenon known as the tides.
Consider the tidal elongation of the Earth due to the Sun. In this case, we have a =
6.37 × 106 m, R = 1.50 × 1011 m, m = 5.97 × 1024 kg, and m ′ = 1.99 × 1030 kg. Hence, we
calculate that −ǫ = 9.6 × 10−8 , or
∆a = a+ − a− = −ǫ a = 0.61 m.

(12.87)

Thus, the tidal elongation due to the Sun is about half that due to the Moon. It follows that
the tides are particularly high when the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon lie approximately in
a straight-line, so that the tidal effects of the Sun and the Moon reinforce one another. This
occurs at a new moon, or at a full moon. These type of tides are called spring tides (note
that the name has nothing to do with the season). Conversely, the tides are particularly
low when the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon form a right-angle, so that the tidal effects
of the Sun and the Moon partially cancel one another. These type of tides are called neap
tides. Generally speaking, we would expect two spring tides and two neap tides per month.
In reality, the amplitude of the tides varies significantly from place to place on the
Earth’s surface, due to the presence of the continents, which impede the flow of the oceanic
tidal bulge around the Earth. Moreover, there is a time-lag of approximately 12 minutes
between the Moon being directly overhead (or directly below) and high tide, because of
the finite inertia of the oceans. Similarly, the time-lag between a spring tide and a full
moon, or a new moon, can be up to 2 days.

12.9 Roche Radius
Consider a spherical moon of mass m and radius a which is in a circular orbit of radius R
about a spherical planet of mass m ′ and radius a ′ . (Strictly speaking, the moon and the
planet execute circular orbits about their common center of mass. However, if the planet
is much more massive than the moon then the center of mass lies close to the planet’s
center.) According to the analysis in the previous section, a constituent element of the

This so-called tidal force is generated by the spatial variation of the planet’s gravitational
field over the interior of the moon, and acts to elongate the moon along an axis joining
its center to that of the planet, and to compress it in any direction perpendicular to this
axis. Note that the magnitude of the tidal force increases strongly as the radius, R, of
the moon’s orbit decreases. Now, if the tidal force becomes sufficiently strong then it can
overcome the moon’s self-gravity, and thereby rip the moon apart. It follows that there is
a minimum radius, generally referred to as the Roche radius, at which a moon can orbit a
planet without being destroyed by tidal forces.
Let us derive an expression for the Roche radius. Consider a small mass element at the
point on the surface of the moon which lies closest to the planet, and at which the tidal
force is consequently largest (i.e., x = y = 0, z = a). According to Equation (12.90),
the mass experiences an upward (from the moon’s surface) tidal acceleration due to the
gravitational attraction of the planet of the form

then the effective gravity is negative. In other words, the tidal force due to the planet is
strong enough to overcome surface gravity and lift objects off the moon’s surface. If this

Gravitational Potential Theory

is the case, and the tensile strength of the moon is negligible, then it is fairly clear that
the tidal force will start to break the moon apart. Hence, Rc is the Roche radius. Now,
m ′ /m = (ρ ′ /ρ) (a ′/a)3 , where ρ and ρ ′ are the mean mass densities of the moon and
planet, respectively. Thus, the above expression for the Roche radius can also be written

(12.95)

The above calculation is somewhat inaccurate, since it fails to take into account the
inevitable distortion of the moon’s shape in the presence of strong tidal forces. (In fact, the
calculation assumes that the moon always remains spherical.) A more accurate calculation,
which treats the moon as a self-gravitating incompressible fluid, yields

(12.96)

It follows that if the planet and the moon have the same mean density then the Roche
radius is 2.44 times the planet’s radius. Note that small orbital bodies such as rocks, or
even very small moons, can survive intact within the Roche radius because they are held
together by internal tensile forces rather than gravitational attraction. However, this mechanism becomes progressively less effective as the size of the body in question increases. Not
surprisingly, virtually all large planetary moons occurring in the Solar System have orbital
radii which exceed the relevant Roche radius, whereas virtually all planetary ring systems
(which consist of myriads of small orbiting rocks) have radii which lie inside the relevant
Roche radius.

Precession and Forced Nutation of the Earth

Consider the Earth-Sun system—see Figure 12.7. From a geocentric viewpoint, the Sun
orbits the Earth counter-clockwise (looking from the north), once per year, in an approximately circular orbit of radius as = 1.50 × 1011 m. In astronomy, the plane of the Sun’s
apparent orbit relative to the Earth is known as the ecliptic plane. Let us define non-rotating
Cartesian coordinates, centered on the Earth, which are such that the x- and y-axes lie in
the ecliptic plane, and the z-axis is normal to this plane (in the sense that the Earth’s north
pole lies at positive z). It follows that the z-axis is directed toward a point in the sky
(located in the constellation Draco) known as the north ecliptic pole. In the following, we
shall treat the Oxyz system as inertial. This is a reasonable approximation because the
orbital acceleration of the Earth is much smaller than the acceleration due to its diurnal
rotation. It is convenient to parameterize the instantaneous position of the Sun in terms
of a counter-clockwise (looking from the north) azimuthal angle λs that is zero on the
positive x-axis—see Figure 12.7.
Let ω be the Earth’s angular velocity vector due to its daily rotation. This vector makes
an angle θ with the z-axis, where θ = 23.44◦ is the mean inclination of the ecliptic to the

Earth’s equatorial plane. Suppose that the projection of ω onto the ecliptic plane subtends
an angle φ with the y-axis, where φ is measured in a counter-clockwise (looking from the
north) sense—see Figure 12.7. The orientation of the Earth’s axis of rotation (which is, of
course, parallel to ω) is thus determined by the two angles θ and φ. Note, however, that
these two angles are also Euler angles, in the sense given in Chapter 8. Let us examine
the Earth-Sun system at an instant in time, t = 0, when φ = 0: i.e., when ω lies in the
y-z plane. At this particular instant, the x-axis points towards the so-called vernal equinox,
which is defined as the point in the sky where the ecliptic plane crosses the projection of
the Earth’s equator (i.e., the plane normal to ω) from south to north. A counter-clockwise
(looking from the north) angle in the ecliptic plane that is zero at the vernal equinox is
generally known as an ecliptic longitude. Thus, λs is the Sun’s ecliptic longitude.
According to Equation (12.66), the potential energy of the Earth-Sun system is written

its equatorial plane, and P2 (x) = (1/2) (3 x2 − 1). Furthermore, γs is the angle subtended
between ω and rs , where rs is the position vector of the Sun relative to the Earth.
It is easily demonstrated that (with φ = 0)
ω = ω (0, sin θ, cos θ),

and use has been made of Equation (12.104). According to the above expression, the
mutual interaction between the Sun and the quadrupole gravitational field generated by
the Earth’s slight oblateness causes the Earth’s axis of rotation to precess steadily about the
normal to the ecliptic plane at the rate −Ωφ . The fact that −Ωφ is negative implies that the
precession is in the opposite direction to the direction of the Earth’s rotation and the Sun’s
apparent orbit about the Earth. Incidentally, the interaction causes a precession of the
Earth’s rotational axis, rather than the plane of the Sun’s orbit, because the Earth’s axial
moment of inertia is much less than the Sun’s orbital moment of inertia. The precession
period in years is given by

Tφ ≃ 79, 200 years.

(12.118)

Unfortunately, the observed precession period of the Earth’s axis of rotation about the
normal to the ecliptic plane is approximately 25,800 years, so something is clearly missing
from our model. It turns out that the missing factor is the influence of the Moon.

where Mm is the lunar mass, and am the radius of the Moon’s (approximately circular)

ω = ω (− sin θ sin φ, sin θ cos φ, cos θ)

(12.120)

is the Earth’s angular velocity vector, and rm is the position vector of the Moon relative to
the Earth. Here, for the moment, we have retained the φ dependence in our expression
for ω (since we shall presently differentiate by φ, before setting φ = 0). Now, the Moon’s
orbital plane is actually slightly inclined to the ecliptic plane, the angle of inclination being
ιm = 5.16◦. Hence, we can write
rm ≃ am (cos λm , sin λm , ιm sin(λm − ̟n )) ,

(12.121)

to first order in ιm , where λm is the Moon’s ecliptic longitude, and ̟n is the ecliptic longitude of the lunar ascending node, which is defined as the point on the lunar orbit where
the Moon crosses the ecliptic plane from south to north. Of course, λm increases at the rate
nm , where

is the Moon’s orbital angular velocity. It turns out that the lunar ascending node precesses

it completes a full circuit every 18.6 years. This precession is caused by the perturbing
influence of the Sun—see Chapter 14. It follows that

the vernal equinox at time t = 0 (i.e., ̟m = 0 at t = 0), in accordance with our previous
assumption that φ = 0 at t = 0.
According to Equation (12.143), the combined gravitational interaction of the Sun and
the Moon with the quadrupole field generated by the Earth’s slight oblateness causes the
Earth’s axis of rotation to precess steadily about the normal to the ecliptic plane at the rate
−Ωφ . As before, the negative sign indicates that the precession is in the opposite direction
to the (apparent) orbital motion of the sun and moon. The period of the precession in

Tφ ≃ 27, 600 years.

(12.149)

192

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

This prediction is fairly close to the observed precession period of 25, 800 years. The main
reason that our estimate is slightly inaccurate is because we have neglected to take into
account the small eccentricities of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, and the Moon’s orbit
around the Earth.
The point in the sky toward which the Earth’s axis of rotation points is known as the
north celestial pole. Currently, this point lies within about a degree of the fairly bright
star Polaris, which is consequently sometimes known as the north star or the pole star. It
follows that Polaris appears to be almost stationary in the sky, always lying due north, and
can thus be used for navigational purposes. Indeed, mariners have relied on the north star
for many hundreds of years to determine direction at sea. Unfortunately, because of the
precession of the Earth’s axis of rotation, the north celestial pole is not a fixed point in the
sky, but instead traces out a circle, of angular radius 23.44◦, about the north ecliptic pole,
with a period of 25,800 years. Hence, a few thousand years from now, the north celestial
pole will no longer coincide with Polaris, and there will be no convenient way of telling
direction from the stars.
The projection of the ecliptic plane onto the sky is called the ecliptic, and coincides with
the apparent path of the Sun against the backdrop of the stars. Furthermore, the projection
of the Earth’s equator onto the sky is known as the celestial equator. As has been previously
mentioned, the ecliptic is inclined at 23.44◦ to the celestial equator. The two points in
the sky at which the ecliptic crosses the celestial equator are called the equinoxes, since
night and day are equally long when the Sun lies at these points. Thus, the Sun reaches
the vernal equinox on about March 21st, and this traditionally marks the beginning of
spring. Likewise, the Sun reaches the autumn equinox on about September 22nd, and this
traditionally marks the beginning of autumn. However, the precession of the Earth’s axis of
rotation causes the celestial equator (which is always normal to this axis) to precess in the
sky, and thus also causes the equinoxes to precess along the ecliptic. This effect is known
as the precession of the equinoxes. The precession is in the opposite direction to the Sun’s
apparent motion around the ecliptic, and is of magnitude 1.4◦ per century. Amazingly, this
miniscule effect was discovered by the Ancient Greeks (with the help of ancient Babylonian
observations). In about 2000 BC, when the science of astronomy originated in ancient
Egypt and Babylonia, the vernal equinox lay in the constellation Aries. Indeed, the vernal
equinox is still sometimes called the first point of Aries in astronomical texts. About 90 BC,
the vernal equinox moved into the constellation Pisces, where it still remains. The equinox
will move into the constellation Aquarius (marking the beginning of the much heralded
“Age of Aquarius”) in about 2600 AD. Incidentally, the position of the vernal equinox in the
sky is of great significance in astronomy, since it is used as the zero of celestial longitude
(much as Greenwich is used as the zero of terrestrial longitude).
Equations (12.143) and (12.144) indicate that the small inclination of the lunar orbit
to the ecliptic plane, combined with the precession of the lunar ascending node, causes
the Earth’s axis of rotation to wobble sightly. This wobble is known as nutation, and is
superimposed on the aforementioned precession. In the absence of precession, nutation
would cause the north celestial pole to periodically trace out a small ellipse on the sky, the

Gravitational Potential Theory

193

sense of rotation being counter-clockwise. The nutation period is 18.6 years: i.e., the same
as the precession period of the lunar ascending node. The nutation amplitudes in the polar
and azimuthal angles θ and φ are
δθ =

(12.151)

respectively, where Tn (yr) = ns /Ωn = 18.6. Given that ǫ = 0.00335, θ0 = 23.44◦, ιm =

(12.153)

δφ = 15.3 .

The observed nutation amplitudes are 9.2 and 17.2 , respectively. Hence, our estimates
are quite close to the mark. Any inaccuracy is mainly due to the fact that we have neglected
to take into account the small eccentricities of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, and the
Moon’s orbit around the Earth. The nutation of the Earth was discovered in 1728 by the
English astronomer James Bradley, and was explained theoretically about 20 years later
by d’Alembert and L. Euler. Nutation is important because the corresponding gyration
of the Earth’s rotation axis appears to be transferred to celestial objects when they are
viewed using terrestrial telescopes. This effect causes the celestial longitudes and latitudes
′′
of heavenly objects to oscillate sinusoidally by up to 20 (i.e., about the maximum angular
size of Saturn) with a period of 18.6 years. It is necessary to correct for this oscillation in
order to accurately guide terrestrial telescopes to particular objects.
Note, finally, that the type of forced nutation discussed above, which is driven by an
external torque, is quite distinct from the free nutation described in Section 8.9.

Perihelion Precession of the Planets

The Solar System consists of eight major planets (Mercury to Neptune) moving around
the Sun in slightly elliptical orbits which are approximately co-planar with one another.
According to Chapter 5, if we neglect the relatively weak interplanetary gravitational interactions then the perihelia of the various planets (i.e., the points on their orbits at which
they are closest to the Sun) remain fixed in space. However, once these interactions are
taken into account, it turns out that the planetary perihelia all slowly precess around the
Sun. We can calculate the approximate rate of perihelion precession of a given planet by
treating the other planets as uniform concentric rings, centered on the Sun, of mass equal
to the planetary mass, and radius equal to the mean orbital radius.1 This is equivalent to
averaging the interplanetary gravitational interactions over the orbits of the other planets.
It is reasonable to do this, since the precession period in question is very much longer than
the orbital period of any planet in the Solar System. Thus, by treating the other planets
as rings, we can calculate the mean gravitational perturbation due to these planets, and,
thereby, determine the desired precession rate.
We can conveniently index the planets in the Solar System such that Mercury is planet
1, and Neptune planet 8. Let the Mi and the Ri , for i = 1, 8, be the planetary masses and
orbital radii, respectively. Furthermore, let M0 be the mass of the Sun. It follows, from
the previous section, that the gravitational potential generated at the ith planet by the Sun
and the other planets is

Table 12.2 and Figure 12.8 compare the observed perihelion precession rates with the
theoretical rates calculated from Equation (12.164) and the planetary data given in Table 12.1. It can be seen that there is excellent agreement between the two, except for
the planet Venus. The main reason for this is that Venus has an unusually low eccentricity
(e = 0.0068), which renders its perihelion point extremely sensitive to small perturbations.

12.13

Perihelion Precession of Mercury

If the calculation described in the previous section is carried out more accurately, taking
into account the slight eccentricities of the planetary orbits, as well as their small mutual
inclinations, and retaining many more terms in the expansions (12.155) and (12.157),
then the perihelion precession rate of the planet Mercury is found to be 5.32 arc seconds
per year. However, the observed precession rate is 5.75 arc seconds per year. It turns out
that the cause of this discrepancy is the general relativistic correction to Newtonian gravity.
General relativity gives rise to a small correction to the force per unit mass exerted by
the Sun (mass M0 ) on a planet in a circular orbit of radius r, and angular momentum per
unit mass h. In fact, the modified formula for f is

arc seconds per year, where R is the mean orbital radius in mean Earth orbital radii, and T
is the orbital period in years. Hence, from Table 12.1, the general relativistic contribution
to δψ̇ for Mercury is 0.41 arc seconds per year. It is easily demonstrated that the corresponding contribution is negligible for the other planets in the Solar System. If the above
calculation is carried out sightly more accurately, taking the eccentricity of Mercury’s orbit
into account, then the general relativistic contribution to δψ̇ becomes 0.43 arc seconds per
year. It follows that the total perihelion precession rate for Mercury is 5.32 + 0.43 = 5.75
arc seconds per year. This is in exact agreement with the observed precession rate. Indeed,
the ability of general relativity to explain the discrepancy between the observed perihelion
precession rate of Mercury, and that calculated from Newtonian dynamics, was one of the
first major successes of this theory.

13 The Three-Body Problem

13.1 Introduction
We saw earlier, in Section 6.2, that an isolated dynamical system consisting of two freely
moving point masses exerting forces on one another—which is usually referred to as a twobody problem—can always be converted into an equivalent one-body problem. In particular, this implies that we can exactly solve a dynamical system containing two gravitationally
interacting point masses, since the equivalent one-body problem is exactly soluble—see
Chapter 5 and Section 6.3. What about a system containing three gravitationally interacting point masses? Despite hundreds of years of research, no exact solution of this famous
problem—which is generally known as the three-body problem—has ever been found. It is,
however, possible to make some progress by severely restricting the problem’s scope.

13.2 Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem
Consider an isolated dynamical system consisting of three gravitationally interacting point
masses, m1 , m2 , and m3 . Suppose, however, that the third mass, m3 , is so much smaller
than the other two that it has a negligible effect on their motion. Suppose, further, that the
first two masses, m1 and m2 , execute circular orbits about their common center of mass.
In the following, we shall investigate this simplified problem, which is generally known as
the circular restricted three-body problem.
Let us define a Cartesian coordinate system (ξ, η, ζ) in an inertial reference frame
whose origin coincides with the center of mass, C, of the two orbiting masses. Furthermore, let the orbital plane of these masses coincide with the ξ-η plane, and let them both
lie on the ξ-axis at time t = 0—see Figure 13.1. Suppose that R is the constant distance
between the two orbiting masses, r1 the constant distance between mass m1 and the origin, and r2 the constant distance between mass m2 and the origin. Moreover, let ω be the
constant orbital angular velocity. It follows, from Section 6.3, that

where M = m1 + m2 .
It is convenient to choose our unit of length such that R = 1, and our unit of mass such
that G M = 1. It follows, from Equation (13.1), that ω = 1. However, we shall continue to
retain ω in our equations, for the sake of clarity. Let µ1 = G m1 , and µ2 = G m2 = 1 − µ1 . It
is easily demonstrated that r1 = µ2, and r2 = 1 − r1 = µ1 . Hence, the two orbiting masses,

m1 and m2 , have position vectors r1 = (ξ1 , η1 , 0) and r2 = (ξ2 , η2 , 0), respectively, where
(see Figure 13.1)
r1 = µ2 (− cos ωt, − sin ωt, 0),

(13.3)

r2 = µ1 (cos ωt, sin ωt, 0).

Moreover, it follows, from Equations (13.3)–(13.4) and (13.8)–(13.9), that

(13.12)

ρ2 ρ̇2 = −(ξ2 ξ̇ + η2 η̇) + ω (ξ η2 − η ξ2 ) + ξ ξ̇ + η η̇ + ζ ζ̇.

(13.13)

Combining Equations (13.5)–(13.7) with the above three expressions, we obtain (after
considerable algebra)
Ċ = 0.
(13.14)
In other words, the function C—which is usually referred to as the Jacobi integral—is a
constant of the motion.
Now, we can rearrange Equation (13.10) to give

where E is the energy (per unit mass) of mass m3 , h = r × ṙ its angular momentum
(per unit mass), and ω = (0, 0, ω) the orbital angular velocity of the other two masses.
Note, however, that h is not a constant of the motion. Hence, E is not a constant of the
motion either. In fact, the Jacobi integral is the only constant of the motion in the circular
restricted three-body problem. Incidentally, the energy of mass m3 is not a conserved
quantity because the other two masses in the system are moving.

13.4 Tisserand Criterion
Consider a dynamical system consisting of three gravitationally interacting point masses,
m1 , m2 , and m3 . Let mass m1 represent the Sun, mass m2 the planet Jupiter, and mass
m3 a comet. Since the mass of a comet is very much less than that of the Sun or Jupiter,
and the Sun and Jupiter are in (almost) circular orbits about their common center of mass,
the dynamical system in question satisfies all of the necessary criteria to be considered an
example of a restricted three-body problem.
Now, the mass of the Sun is much greater than that of Jupiter. It follows that the
gravitational effect of Jupiter on the cometary orbit is negligible unless the comet makes
a very close approach to Jupiter. Hence, as described in Chapter 5, before and after such
an approach, the comet executes a standard elliptical orbit about the Sun with fixed orbital parameters: i.e., fixed major radius, eccentricity, and inclination to the ecliptic plane.
However, in general, the orbital parameters before and after the close approach will not
be the same as one another. Let us investigate further.

204

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

Now, since m1 ≫ m2 , we have µ1 = G m1 ≃ G (m1 + m2 ) = 1, and ρ1 ≃ r. Hence,
according to Equations (5.51) and (5.60), the (approximately) conserved energy (per unit
mass) of the comet before and after its close approach to Jupiter is
E≡


1 2

ξ̇ + η̇ 2 + ζ̇ 2 − = − .
2
r
2a

(13.16)

Note that the comet’s orbital energy is entirely determined by its major radius, a. (Incidentally, we are working in units such that the major radius of Jupiter’s orbit is unity.)
Furthermore, the (approximately) conserved angular momentum (per unit mass) of the
comet before and after its approach to Jupiter is written h, where h is directed normal to
the comet’s orbital plane, and, from Equations (5.27) and (5.47),
h2 = a (1 − e2 ).

(13.17)

Here, e is the comet’s orbital eccentricity. It follows that
ω · h = ω h cos I =

q

a (1 − e2 ) cos I,

(13.18)

since ω = 1 in our adopted system of units. Here, I is the angle of inclination of the normal
to the comet’s orbital plane to that of Jupiter’s orbital plane.
Let a, e, and I be the major radius, eccentricity, and inclination angle of the cometary
orbit before the close encounter with Jupiter, and let a ′ , e ′ , and I ′ be the corresponding
parameters after the encounter. It follows from Equations (13.15), (13.16), and (13.18),
and the fact that C is conserved during the encounter, whereas E and h are not, that

+ a (1 − e2 ) cos I =

(13.19)

This result is known as the Tisserand criterion, and restricts the possible changes in the
orbital parameters of a comet due to a close encounter with Jupiter (or any other massive
planet).
The Tisserand criterion is very useful. For instance, whenever a new comet is discovered, astronomers immediately calculate its Tisserand parameter,
TJ =

q
1
+ 2 a (1 − e2 ) cos I.
a

(13.20)

If this parameter has the same value as that of a previously observed comet then it is quite
likely that the new comet is, in fact, the same comet, but that its orbital parameters have
changed since it was last observed, due to a close encounter with Jupiter. Incidentally,
the subscript J in the above formula is to remind us that we are dealing with the Tisserand
parameter for close encounters with Jupiter. (The parameter is, thus, evaluated in a system
of units in which the major radius of Jupiter’s orbit is unity). Obviously, it is also possible
to calculate Tisserand parameters for close encounters with other planets.
The Tisserand criterion is also applicable to so-called gravity assists, in which a spacecraft gains energy due to a close encounter with a moving planet. Such assists are often

employed in missions to the outer planets to reduce the amount of fuel which the spacecraft must carry in order to reach its destination. In fact, it is clear, from Equations (13.16)
and (13.19), that a space-craft can make use of a close encounter with a moving planet to
increase (or decrease) its orbital major radius a, and, hence, to increase (or decrease) its
total orbital energy.

13.5 Co-Rotating Frame
Let us transform to a non-inertial frame of reference rotating with angular velocity ω about
an axis normal to the orbital plane of masses m1 and m2 , and passing through their center
of mass. It follows that masses m1 and m2 appear stationary in this new reference frame.
Let us define a Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z) in the rotating frame of reference
which is such that masses m1 and m2 always lie on the x-axis, and the z-axis is parallel
to the previously defined ζ-axis. It follows that masses m1 and m2 have the fixed position
vectors r1 = µ2 (−1, 0, 0) and r2 = µ1 (1, 0, 0) in our new coordinate system. Finally, let
the position vector of mass m3 be r = (x, y, z)—see Figure 13.2.
According to Chapter 7, the equation of motion of mass m3 in the rotating reference
frame takes the form

are identical]. Note, finally, that the mass m3 is restricted to regions in which
−2 U ≥ C,
since v2 is a positive definite quantity.

13.6 Lagrange Points
Let us search for possible equilibrium points of the mass m3 in the rotating reference frame.
Such points are termed Lagrange points. Thus, in the rotating frame, the mass m3 would
remain at rest if placed at one of the Lagrange points. It is, thus, clear that these points
are fixed in the rotating frame. Conversely, in the inertial reference frame, the Lagrange
points rotate about the center of mass with angular velocity ω, and the mass m3 would
consequently also rotate about the center of mass with angular velocity ω if placed at one
of these points (with the appropriate velocity). In the following, we shall assumed, without
loss of generality, that m1 ≥ m2 .
The Lagrange points satisfy ṙ = r̈ = 0 in the rotating frame. It thus follows, from
Equations (13.27)–(13.29), that the Lagrange points are the solutions of

(13.61)

Note that V ≥ 0. It follows, from Equation (13.35), that if the mass m3 has the Jacobi
integral C, and lies on the surface specified in Equation (13.60), then it must have zero
velocity. Hence, such a surface is termed a zero-velocity surface. The zero-velocity surfaces
are important because they form the boundary of regions from which the mass m3 is
dynamically excluded: i.e., regions in which V < C. Generally speaking, the regions from
which m3 is excluded grow in area as C increases, and vice versa.
Let Ci be the value of V at the Li Lagrange point, for i = 1, 5. When µ2 ≪ 1, it is easily
demonstrated that

C4 ≃ 3 − µ2 .

(13.64)
(13.65)
(13.66)

Note that C1 > C2 > C3 > C4 = C5 .
Figures 13.4–13.8 show the intersection of the zero-velocity surface V = C with the
x-y plane for various different values of C, and illustrate how the region from which m3
is dynamically excluded—which we shall term the excluded region—evolves as the value
of C is varied. Of course, any point not in the excluded region is in the so-called allowed
region. For C > C1 , the allowed region consists of two separate oval regions centered on
m1 and m2 , respectively, plus an outer region which lies beyond a large circle centered
on the origin. All three allowed regions are separated from one another by an excluded
region—see Figure 13.4. When C = C1 , the two inner allowed regions merge at the L1
point—see Figure 13.5. When C = C2 , the inner and outer allowed regions merge at the
L2 point, forming a horseshoe-like excluded region—see Figure 13.6. When C = C3 , the
excluded region splits in two at the L3 point—see Figure 13.7. For C4 < C < C3 , the two
excluded regions are localized about the L4 and L5 points—see Figure 13.8. Finally, for
C < C4 , there is no excluded region.
Figure 13.9 shows the zero-velocity surfaces and Lagrange points calculated for the
case µ2 = 0.01. It can be seen that, at very small values of µ2 , the L1 and L2 Lagrange
points are almost equidistant from mass m2 . Furthermore, mass m2 , and the L3 , L4 , and L5
Lagrange points all lie approximately on a unit circle, centered on mass m1 . It follows that,
when µ2 is small, the Lagrange points L3 , L4 and L5 all share the orbit of mass m2 about m1

13.8 Stability of Lagrange Points
We have seen that the five Lagrange points, L1 to L5 , are the equilibrium points of mass m3
in the co-rotating frame. Let us now determine whether or not these equilibrium points
are stable to small displacements.
Now, the equations of motion of mass m3 in the co-rotating frame are specified in Equations (13.27)–(13.29). Note that the motion in the x-y plane is complicated by presence
of the Coriolis acceleration. However, the motion parallel to the z-axis simply corresponds
to motion in the potential U. Hence, the condition for the stability of the Lagrange points
(which all lie at z = 0) to small displacements parallel to the z-axis is simply (see Section 3.2)
!

This condition is satisfied everywhere in the x-y plane. Hence, the Lagrange points are all
stable to small displacements parallel to the z-axis. It, thus, remains to investigate their
stability to small displacements lying within the x-y plane.
Suppose that a Lagrange point is situated in the x-y plane at coordinates (x0 , y0 , 0).
Let us consider small amplitude x-y motion in the vicinity of this point by writing
x = x0 + δx,

(13.69)

z = 0,

(13.70)

where δx and δy are infinitesimal. Expanding U(x, y, 0) about the Lagrange point as a

where U0 = U(x0 , y0, 0), Ux = ∂U(x0 , y0 , 0)/∂x, Uxx = ∂2 U(x0 , y0 , 0)/∂x2 , etc. However, by
definition, Ux = Uy = 0 at a Lagrange point, so the expansion simplifies to
U = U0 +

1
1
Uxx (δx)2 + Uxy δx δy + Uyy (δy)2 .

(13.72)

Finally, substitution of Equations (13.68)–(13.70), and (13.72) into the equations of x-y
motion, (13.27) and (13.28), yields
δẍ − 2 δẏ = −Uxx δx − Uxy δy,

(13.73)

δÿ + 2 δẋ = −Uxy δx − Uyy δy,

(13.74)

since ω = 1.
Let us search for a solution of the above pair of equations of the form δx(t) = δx0 exp(γ t)
and δy(t) = δy0 exp(γ t). We obtain

where all terms are evaluated at the point (x0 , y0 , 0). It thus follows that
Uxx = A − D − 1,

(13.81)

Uyy = A − B − 1,

(13.82)

Uxy = −C.

(13.83)

Consider the co-linear Lagrange points, L1 , L2 , and L3 . These all lie on the x-axis, and
are thus characterized by y = 0, ρ12 = (x + µ2 )2 , and ρ22 = (x − µ1)2 . It follows, from the
above equations, that B = C = 0 and D = 3 A. Hence, Uxx = −1 − 2 A, Uyy = A − 1, and
Uxy = 0. Equation (13.76) thus yields
Γ 2 + (2 − A) Γ + (1 − A) (1 + 2 A) = 0,

(13.84)

where Γ = γ2 . Now, in order for a Lagrange point to be stable to small displacements, all
four of the roots, γ, of Equation (13.76) must be purely imaginary. This, in turn, implies
that the two roots of the above equation,
Γ=

A−2±

(13.85)

must both be real and negative. Thus, the stability criterion is
8
≤ A ≤ 1.

(13.86)

Figure 13.10 shows A calculated at the three co-linear Lagrange points as a function of µ2 ,
for all allowed values of this parameter (i.e., 0 < µ2 ≤ 0.5). It can be seen that A is always
greater than unity for all three points. Hence, we conclude that the co-linear Lagrange
points, L1 , L2 , and L3 , are intrinsically unstable equilibrium points in the co-rotating frame.
Let us now consider the triangular Lagrange points, L4 and L5 . q
These points are characterized by ρ1 = ρ2 = 1. It follows that A = 1, B = 9/4, C = ± 27/16 (1 − 2 µ2), and
q

D = 3/4. Hence, Uxx = −3/4, Uyy = −9/4, and Uxy = ∓ 27/16 (1 − 2 µ2), where the
upper/lower signs corresponds to L4 and L5 , respectively. Equation (13.76) thus yields
Γ2 + Γ +

27
µ2 (1 − µ2 ) = 0

(13.87)

for both points, where Γ = γ2. As before, the stability criterion is that the two roots
of the above equation must both be real and negative. This is the case provided that
1 > 27 µ2 (1 − µ2 ), which yields the stability criterion

In unnormalized units, this criterion becomes

m1 + m2

(13.89)

We thus conclude that the L4 and L5 Lagrange points are stable equilibrium points, in
the co-rotating frame, provided that mass m2 is less than about 4% of mass m1 . If this
is the case then mass m3 can orbit around these points indefinitely. In the inertial frame,
the mass will share the orbit of mass m2 about mass m1 , but will stay approximately
60◦ ahead of mass m2 , if it is orbiting the L4 point, or 60◦ behind, if it is orbiting the L5
point—see Figure 13.9. This type of behavior has been observed in the Solar System. For
instance, there is a sub-class of asteroids, known as the Trojan asteroids, which are trapped
in the vicinity of the L4 and L5 points of the Sun-Jupiter system (which easily satisfies the
above stability criterion), and consequently share Jupiter’s orbit around the Sun, staying
approximately 60◦ ahead of, and 60◦ behind, Jupiter, respectively. Furthermore, the L4 and
L5 points of the Sun-Earth system are occupied by clouds of dust.

Lunar Motion

219

14 Lunar Motion

14.1 Historical Background
The motion of the Planets around the Sun is fairly accurately described by Kepler’s laws
(see Chapter 5). Likewise, to a first approximation, the motion of the Moon around the
Earth can also be accounted for via these laws. However, unlike the planetary orbits, the
deviations of the lunar orbit from a Keplerian ellipse are sufficiently large that they are
easily apparent to the naked eye. Indeed, the largest of these deviations, which is generally known as evection, was discovered in ancient times by the Alexandrian astronomer
Claudius Ptolemy (90–168 AD). Moreover, the next largest deviation, which is called variation, was first observed by Tycho Brahe (1546–1601) without the aid of a telescope.
Another non-Keplerian feature of the lunar orbit, which is sufficient obvious that it was
known to the ancient Greeks, is the fact that the lunar perigee (i.e., the point of closest
approach to the Earth) precesses (i.e., orbits about the Earth in the same direction as the
Moon) at such a rate that it completes a full circuit every 8.85 years.1 The ancient Greeks
also noticed that the lunar ascending node (i.e., the point at which the Moon passes through
the fixed plane of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun from south to north) regresses (i.e., orbits about the Earth in the opposite direction to the Moon) at such a rate that it completes
a full circuit every 18.6 years. Of course, according to standard two-body orbit theory,
both the lunar perigee and ascending node should be stationary (see Chapter 5).
Newton demonstrated, in Book III of his Principia, that the deviations of the lunar orbit
from a Keplerian ellipse are due to the gravitational influence of the Sun, which is sufficiently large that it is not completely negligible compared with the mutual gravitational
attraction of the Earth and the Moon. However, Newton was not able to give a complete
account of these deviations, due to the complexity of the equations of motion which arise
in a system of three mutually gravitating bodies (see Chapter 13). In fact, Clairaut (1713–
1765) is generally credited with the first reasonably accurate and complete theoretical
explanation of the Moon’s orbit. His method of calculation makes use of an expansion of
the lunar equations of motion in terms of various small parameters. Clairaut, however,
initially experienced difficulty in accounting for the precession of the lunar perigee. Indeed, his first calculation overestimated the period of this precession by a factor of about
two, leading him to question Newton’s inverse-square law of gravitation. Later on, he
realized that he could indeed account for the precession, in terms of standard Newtonian dynamics, by continuing his expansion in small parameters to higher order. After
Clairaut, the theory of lunar motion was further elaborated in major works by D’Alembert
(1717–1783), Euler (1707–1783), Laplace (1749–1827), Damoiseau (1768–1846), Plana
(1781–1864), Poisson (1781–1840), Hansen (1795–1874), De Pontécoulant (1795–1824),

Note that this precession rate is about 104 times greater than any of the planetary perihelion precession
rates discussed in Section 12.12.

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

J. Herschel (1792–1871), Airy (1801–1892), Delaunay (1816–1872), G.W. Hill (1836–
1914), and E.W. Brown (1836–1938). The fact that so many celebrated mathematicians
and astronomers devoted so much time and effort to lunar theory is a tribute to its inherent
difficulty, as well as its great theoretical and practical interest. Indeed, for a period of about
one hundred years (between 1767 and about 1850) the so-called method of lunar distance
was the principal means used by mariners to determine longitude at sea. This method
depends crucially on a precise knowledge of the position of the Moon in the sky as a function of time. Consequently, astronomers and mathematicians during the period in question
were spurred to make ever more accurate observations of the Moon’s orbit, and to develop
lunar theory to greater and greater precision. An important outcome of these activities
were various tables of lunar motion (e.g., those of Mayer, Damoiseau, Plana, Hansen, and
Brown), most of which were published at public expense. Finally, it is worth noting that
the development of lunar theory gave rise to many significant advances in mathematics
and dynamics, and was, in many ways, a precursor to the discovery of chaotic motion in
the 20th century (see Chapter 15).
This chapter contains an introduction to lunar theory in which approximate expressions
for evection, variation, the precession of the perigee, and the regression of the ascending
node are derived from the laws of Newtonian dynamics.2

14.2 Preliminary Analysis
Let rE and rM be the position vectors of the Earth and Moon, respectively, in a non-rotating
reference frame in which the Sun is at rest at the origin. Treating this reference frame as
inertial (which is an excellent approximation, given that the mass of the Sun is very much
greater than that of the Earth or the Moon—see Chapter 6), the Earth’s equation of motion
becomes (see Chapter 5)

r̈E = −n ′ 2 a ′ 3

(14.1)
|rE | 3
where n ′ = 0.98560025◦ per day and a ′ = 149, 598, 261 km are the mean angular velocity
and major radius, respectively, of the terrestrial orbit about the Sun. Here, ¨ ≡ d2 /dt2 . On
the other hand, the Moon’s equation of motion takes the form

where n = 13.17639646◦ per day and a = 384, 399 km are the mean angular velocity
and major radius, respectively, of the lunar orbit about the Earth. Note that we have
retained the perturbing influence (i.e., acceleration) of the Sun in the lunar equation of
motion, (14.2), whilst neglecting the perturbing influence of the Moon in the terrestrial

equation of motion, (14.1), since the former influence is significantly greater (by a factor
ME /MM ≃ 81, where ME is the mass of the Earth, and MM the mass of the Moon) than
the latter.
Let
r = rM − rE ,

(14.3)

r ′ = −rE ,

(14.4)

be the position vectors of the Moon and Sun, respectively, relative to the Earth. It follows,
from Equations (14.1)–(14.4), that in a non-inertial reference frame, S (say), in which the
Earth is at rest at the origin, but the coordinate axes point in fixed directions, the lunar and
solar equations of motion take the form

respectively.
Let us set up a conventional Cartesian coordinate system in S which is such that the
(apparent) orbit of the Sun about the Earth lies in the x-y plane. This implies that the x-y
plane corresponds to the so-called ecliptic plane. Accordingly, in S, the Sun appears to orbit
the Earth at the mean angular velocity ω ′ = n ′ ez (assuming that the z-axis points toward
the so-called north ecliptic pole), whereas the projection of the Moon onto the ecliptic
plane orbits the Earth at the mean angular velocity ω = n ez .
In the following, for the sake of simplicity, we shall neglect the small eccentricity, e ′ =
0.016711, of the Sun’s apparent orbit about the Earth (which is actually the eccentricity
of the Earth’s orbit about the Sun), and approximate the solar orbit as a circle, centered
on the Earth. Thus, if x ′ , y ′ , z ′ are the Cartesian coordinates of the Sun in S then an
appropriate solution of the solar equation of motion, (14.6), is
x ′ = a ′ cos(n ′ t),

y ′ = a ′ sin(n ′ t),

14.3 Lunar Equations of Motion
It is convenient to solve the lunar equation of motion, (14.5), in a geocentric frame of
reference, S1 (say), which rotates with respect to S at the fixed angular velocity ω. Thus,
if the lunar orbit were a circle, centered on the Earth, and lying in the ecliptic plane, then
the Moon would appear stationary in S1 . In fact, the small eccentricity of the lunar orbit,

222

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

e = 0.05488, combined with its slight inclination to the ecliptic plane, ι = 5.161◦ , causes
the Moon to execute a small periodic orbit about the stationary point.
Let x, y, z and x1 , y1 , z1 be the Cartesian coordinates of the Moon in S and S1 , respectively. It is easily demonstrated that (see Section A.16)
x = x1 cos(n t) − y1 sin(n t),

(14.10)

y = x1 sin(n t) + y1 cos(n t),

(14.11)

z = z1 .

(14.12)

Moreover, if x1′ , y1′ , z1′ are the Cartesian components of the Sun in S1 then (see Section A.5)
x1′ = x ′ cos(n t) + y ′ sin(n t),

(14.13)

y1′ = −x ′ sin(n t) + y ′ cos(n t),

(14.14)

z1′ = z ′ ,

(14.15)

giving
x1′ = a ′ cos[(n − n ′ ) t],

(14.16)

y1′ = −a ′ sin[(n − n ′ ) t],

(14.17)

z1′ = 0,

(14.18)

where use has been made of Equations (14.7)–(14.9).
Now, in the rotating frame S1 , the lunar equation of motion (14.5) transforms to (see

where r = (x12 + y12 + z12 )1/2 , and use has been made of Equations (14.16)–(14.18).
It is convenient, at this stage, to normalize all lengths to a, and all times to n−1 . Accordingly, let
X = x1 /a,

(14.24)

Y = y1 /a,

(14.25)

Z = z1 /a,

(14.26)

and r/a = R = (X2 + Y 2 + Z2 )1/2 , and T = n t. In normalized form, Equations (14.21)–

respectively, where m = n ′ /n = 0.07480 is a measure of the perturbing influence of the
Sun on the lunar orbit. Here, ¨ ≡ d2 /dT 2 and ˙ ≡ d/dT .
Finally, let us write
X = X0 + δX,

(14.30)

Y = δY,

(14.31)

Z = δZ,

(14.32)

where X0 = (1 + m2 /2)−1/3 , and |δX|, |δY|, |δZ| ≪ X0 . Thus, if the lunar orbit were a
circle, centered on the Earth, and lying in the ecliptic plane, then, in the rotating frame S1 ,
the Moon would appear stationary at the point (X0 , 0, 0). Expanding Equations (14.27)–
(14.29) to second-order in δX, δY, δZ, and neglecting terms of order m4 and m2 δX 2 , etc.,
we obtain

(14.35)

Now, once the above three equations have been solved for δX, δY, and δZ, the Cartesian
coordinates, x, y, z, of the Moon in the non-rotating geocentric frame S are obtained from
Equations (14.10)–(14.12), (14.24)–(14.26), and (14.30)–(14.32). However, it is more
convenient to write x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, and z = r sin β, where r is the radial distance
between the Earth and Moon, and θ and β are termed the Moon’s ecliptic longitude and
ecliptic latitude, respectively. Moreover, it is easily seen that, to second-order in δX, δY, δZ,

14.4 Unperturbed Lunar Motion
Let us, first of all, neglect the perturbing influence of the Sun on the Moon’s orbit by setting
m = 0 in the lunar equations of motion (14.33)–(14.35). For the sake of simplicity, let us
also neglect nonlinear effects in these equations by setting δX2 = δY 2 = δZ2 = δX δY =
δX δZ = 0. In this case, the equations reduce to
δẌ − 2 δẎ − 3 δX ≃ 0,

(14.39)

δŸ + 2 δẊ ≃ 0,

(14.40)

δZ̈ + δZ ≃ 0.

(14.41)

δX ≃ −e cos(T − α0 ),

(14.42)

δZ ≃ i sin(T − γ0 ),

(14.44)

By inspection, appropriate solutions are

δY ≃ 2 e sin(T − α0 ),

(14.43)

where e, α0 , i, and γ0 are arbitrary constants. Recalling that T = n t, it follows from
(14.36)–(14.38) that
r ≃ a [1 − e cos(n t − α0 )] ,

(14.45)

β ≃ ι sin(n t − γ0 ).

(14.47)

θ ≃ n t + 2 e sin(n t − α0 ),

(14.46)

Lunar Motion

225

However, Equations (14.45) and (14.46) are simply first-order (in e) approximations to
the familiar Keplerian laws (see Chapter 5)
a (1 − e2 )
,
1 + e cos(θ − α0 )

r =

r2 θ̇ = (1 − e2 )1/2 n a2 ,

(14.48)
(14.49)

where ˙ ≡ d/dt. Of course, the above two laws describe a body which executes an elliptical
orbit, confocal with the Earth, of major radius a, mean angular velocity n, and eccentricity
e, such that the radius vector connecting the body to the Earth sweeps out equal areas in
equal time intervals. We conclude, unsurprisingly, that the unperturbed lunar orbit is a
Keplerian ellipse. Note that the lunar perigee lies at the fixed ecliptic longitude θ = α0 .
Equation (14.47) is the first-order approximation to
β = ι sin(θ − γ0 ).

(14.50)

This expression implies that the unperturbed lunar orbit is co-planar, but is inclined at an
angle ι to the ecliptic plane. Moreover, the ascending node lies at the fixed ecliptic longitude
θ = γ0 . Incidentally, the neglect of nonlinear terms in Equations (14.39)–(14.41) is only
valid as long as e, ι ≪ 1: i.e., provided that the unperturbed lunar orbit is only slightly
elliptical, and slightly inclined to the ecliptic plane. In fact, the observed values of e and ι
are 0.05488 and 0.09008 radians, respectively, so this is indeed the case.

14.5 Perturbed Lunar Motion

The angular frequencies, ωj , Ωj , and phase shifts, αj , γj , of the principal periodic driving terms that appear on the right-hand sides of the perturbed nonlinear lunar equations of
motion, (14.51)–(14.53), are specified in Table 14.1. Here, c and g are, as yet, unspecified
O(1) constants associated with the precession of the lunar perigee, and the regression of
the ascending node, respectively. Note that ω1 and Ω1 are the frequencies of the Moon’s
unforced motion in ecliptic longitude and latitude, respectively. Moreover, ω4 is the forcing frequency associated with the perturbing influence of the Sun. All other frequencies
appearing in Table 14.1 are combinations of these three fundamental frequencies. In fact,
ω2 = 2 ω1, ω3 = 2 Ω1 , ω5 = ω4 − ω1 , Ω2 = ω1 − Ω1 , Ω3 = ω1 + Ω1 , and Ω5 = ω4 − Ω1 .
Note that there is no Ω4 .

Table 14.2. Note that, in calculating these amplitudes, we have neglected all contributions to the periodic driving terms, appearing in Equations (14.51)–(14.53) which involve
cubic, or higher order, combinations of e, ι, m2 , xj , yj , and zj , since we only expanded

14.6 Description of Lunar Motion
In order to better understand the perturbed lunar motion derived in the previous section,
it is helpful to introduce the concept of the mean moon. This is an imaginary body which
orbits the Earth, in the ecliptic plane, at a steady angular velocity that is equal to the
Moon’s mean orbital angular velocity, n. Likewise, the mean sun is a second imaginary
body which orbits the Earth, in the ecliptic plane, at a steady angular velocity that is equal
to the Sun’s mean orbital angular velocity, n ′ . Thus, the ecliptic longitudes of the mean
moon and the mean sun are
θ̄ = n t,

(14.98)

θ̄ ′ = n ′ t,

(14.99)

Lunar Motion

231

respectively. Here, for the sake of simplicity, and also for the sake of consistency with our
previous analysis, we have assumed that both objects are located at ecliptic longitude 0◦
at time t = 0.
Now, from Equation (14.95), to first-order in small parameters, the lunar perigee corresponds to (1 + c m2 ) n t − α0 = j 2π, where j is an integer. However, this condition can
also be written θ̄ = α, where
α = α0 + α1 n ′ t,
(14.100)
and, making use of Equation (14.89), together with the definition m = n ′ /n,
α1 =

3
255 2
m+
m + O(m3 ).
4
32

(14.101)

Thus, we can identify α as the mean ecliptic longitude of the perigee. Moreover, according
to Equation (14.100), the perigee precesses (i.e., its longitude increases in time) at the
mean rate of 360 α1 degrees per year. (Of course, a year corresponds to ∆t = 2π/n ′ .)
Furthermore, it is clear that this precession is entirely due to the perturbing influence of the
Sun, since it only depends on the parameter m, which is a measure of this influence. Given
that m = 0.07480, we find that the perigee advances by 34.36◦ degrees per year. Hence, we
predict that the perigee completes a full circuit about the Earth every 1/α1 = 10.5 years. In
fact, the lunar perigee completes a full circuit every 8.85 years. Our prediction is somewhat
inaccurate because our previous analysis neglected O(m2 ), and smaller, contributions to
the parameter c [see Equation (14.89)], and these turn out to be significant.
From Equation (14.97), to first-order in small parameters, the Moon passes through its
ascending node when (1 + g m2) n t − γ0 = γ0 + j 2π, where j is an integer. However, this
condition can also be written θ̄ = γ, where
γ = γ0 − γ1 n ′ t,

(14.102)

and, making use of Equation (14.91),
γ1 =

9 2
3
m−
m + O(m3 ).
4
32

(14.103)

Thus, we can identify γ as the mean ecliptic longitude of the ascending node. Moreover,
according to Equation (14.102), the ascending node regresses (i.e., its longitude decreases
in time) at the mean rate of 360 γ1 degrees per year. As before, it is clear that this regression is entirely due to the perturbing influence of the Sun. Moreover, we find that the
ascending node retreats by 19.63◦ degrees per year. Hence, we predict that the ascending node completes a full circuit about the Earth every 1/γ1 = 18.3 years. In fact, the
lunar ascending node completes a full circuit every 18.6 years, so our prediction is fairly
accurate.
It is helpful to introduce the lunar mean anomaly,
M = θ̄ − α,

(14.104)

232

which is defined as the angular distance (in longitude) between the mean Moon and the
perigee. It is also helpful to introduce the lunar mean argument of latitude,
F = θ̄ − γ,

(14.105)

which is defined as the angular distance (in longitude) between the mean Moon and the
ascending node. Finally, it is helpful to introduce the mean elongation of the Moon,
D = θ̄ − θ̄ ′ ,

(14.106)

which is defined as the difference between the longitudes of the mean Moon and the mean
Sun.
When expressed in terms of M, F, and D, our previous expression (14.96) for the true
ecliptic longitude of the Moon becomes

is the angular distance (in longitude) between the Moon and the mean Moon. The first
three terms on the right-hand side of the above expression are Keplerian (i.e., they are
independent of the perturbing action of the Sun). In fact, the first is due to the eccentricity
of the lunar orbit (i.e., the fact that the geometric center of the orbit is slightly shifted
from the Earth), the second is due to the ellipticity of the orbit (i.e., the fact that the
orbit is slightly non-circular), and the third is due to the slight inclination of the orbit to
the ecliptic plane. However, the final two terms are caused by the perturbing action of
the Sun. In fact, the fourth term corresponds to variation, whilst the fifth corresponds
to evection. Note that variation attains its maximal amplitude around the so-called octant
points, at which the Moon’s disk is either one-quarter or three-quarters illuminated (i.e.,
when D = 45◦ , 135◦ , 225◦ , or 315◦ ). Conversely, the amplitude of variation is zero around
the so-called quadrant points, at which the Moon’s disk is either fully illuminated, half
illuminated, or not illuminated at all (i.e., when D = 0◦ , 90◦ , 180◦, or 270◦ ). Evection can
be thought of as causing a slight reduction in the eccentricity of the lunar orbit around
the times of the new moon and the full moon (i.e., D = 0◦ and D = 180◦ ), and causing
a corresponding slight increase in the eccentricity around the times of the first and last
quarter moons (i.e., D = 90◦ and D = 270◦ ). This follows because the evection term
in Equation (14.108) augments the eccentricity term, 2 e sin M, when cos 2D = −1, and
reduces the term when cos 2D = +1. The variation and evection terms appearing in
expression (14.108) oscillate sinusoidally with periods of half a synodic month,3 or 14.8

days, and 31.8 days, respectively. These periods are in good agreement with observations.
Finally, the amplitudes of the variation and evection terms (calculated using m = 0.07480
and e = 0.05488) are 1630 and 3218 arc seconds, respectively. However, the observed
amplitudes are 2370 and 4586 arc seconds, respectively. It turns out that our expressions for
these amplitudes are somewhat inaccurate because, for the sake of simplicity, we have only
calculated the lowest order (in m) contributions to them. Recall that we also neglected
the slight eccentricity, e ′ = 0.016711, of the Sun’s apparent orbit about the Earth in our
calculation. In fact, the eccentricity of the solar orbit gives rise to a small addition term
−3 m e ′ sin M ′ on the right-hand side of (14.108), where M ′ is the Sun’s mean anomaly.
This term, which is known as the annual equation, oscillates with a period of a solar year,
and has an amplitude of 772 arc seconds.
When expressed in terms of D and F our previous expression (14.97) for the ecliptic
latitude of the Moon becomes
β = ι sin(F + λ) +

3
m ι sin(2 D − F).
8

(14.109)

The first term on the right-hand side of this expression is Keplerian (i.e., it is independent
of the perturbing influence of the Sun). However, the final term, which is known as evection
in latitude, is due to the Sun’s action. Evection in latitude can be thought of as causing a
slight increase in the inclination of the lunar orbit to the ecliptic at the times of the first
and last quarter moons, and a slight decrease at the times of the new moon and the full
moon. The evection in latitude term oscillates sinusoidally with a period of 32.3 days, and
has an amplitude of 521 arc seconds. This period is in good agreement with observations.
However, the observed amplitude of the evection in latitude term is 624 arc seconds. As
before, our expression for the amplitude is somewhat inaccurate because we have only
calculated the lowest order (in m) contribution.

15 The Chaotic Pendulum

15.1 Introduction
Up until now, we have only dealt with dynamical problems which are capable of analytic
solution. Let us now investigate a problem which is quite intractable analytically, and in
which meaningful progress can only be made via numerical methods.

15.2 Basic Problem
Consider a simple pendulum consisting of a point mass m, at the end of a light rigid rod of
length l, attached to a fixed frictionless pivot which allows the rod (and the mass) to move
freely under gravity in the vertical plane. Such a pendulum is sketched in Figure 15.1. Let
us parameterize the instantaneous position of the pendulum via the angle θ the rod makes
with the downward vertical. It is assumed that the pendulum is free to swing through a
full circle. Hence, θ and θ + 2π both correspond to the same pendulum position.
The angular equation of motion of the pendulum is simply
ml

d2 θ
+ m g sin θ = 0,
dt2

(15.1)

where g is the downward acceleration due to gravity—see Section 3.10. Suppose that the
pendulum is embedded in a viscous medium (e.g., air). Let us assume that the viscous drag
torque acting on the pendulum is directly proportional to the pendulum’s instantaneous
velocity. It follows that, in the presence of viscous drag, the above equation generalizes to
d2 θ
dθ
ml 2 + ν
+ m g sin θ = 0,
dt
dt

(15.2)

where ν is a positive constant parameterizing the viscosity of the medium in question—
see Section 3.5. Of course, viscous damping will eventually drain all energy from the
pendulum, leaving it in a stationary state. In order to maintain the motion against viscosity,
it is necessary to add some external driving. For the sake of simplicity, we choose a fixed
amplitude periodic drive (which could arise, for instance, via periodic oscillations of the
pendulum’s pivot point). Thus, the final equation of motion of the pendulum is written
ml

where A and ω are constants parameterizing the amplitude and frequency of the external

From now on, the hats on normalized quantities will be omitted, for ease of notation.
Note that, in normalized units, the natural frequency of small amplitude oscillations is
unity. Moreover, Q is the familiar quality-factor, which is, roughly speaking, the number
of oscillations of the undriven system which must elapse before its energy is significantly
reduced via the action of viscosity—see Section 3.6. The quantity A is the amplitude of the
external torque measured in units of the maximum possible gravitational torque. Finally,
ω is the oscillation frequency of the external torque measured in units of the pendulum’s
natural frequency.
Equation (15.9) is clearly a second-order ordinary differential equation. It can, therefore, also be written as two coupled first-order ordinary differential equations:

15.3 Analytic Solution
Before attempting a numerical solution of the equations of motion of any dynamical system, it is a good idea to, first, investigate the equations as thoroughly as possible via
standard analytic techniques. Unfortunately, Equations (15.10) and (15.11) constitute a
non-linear dynamical system—because of the presence of the sin θ term on the right-hand
side of Equation (15.11). This system, like most non-linear systems, does not possess a
simple analytic solution. Fortunately, however, if we restrict our attention to small amplitude oscillations, such that the approximation
sin θ ≃ θ

(15.12)

is valid, then the system becomes linear, and can easily be solved analytically.
The linearized equations of motion of the pendulum take the form:

Suppose that the pendulum’s position, θ(0), and velocity, v(0), are specified at time t = 0.
As is well-known, in this case, the above equations of motion can be solved analytically to
give:

and it is assumed that Q > 1/2. It can be seen that the above expressions for θ and v both
consist of three terms. The first two terms clearly represent transients, since they depend
on the initial conditions, and decay exponentially in time—see Section 3.9. In fact, the efolding time for the decay of these terms is 2 Q (in normalized time units). The final term
represents the time-asymptotic motion of the pendulum, and is manifestly independent of
the initial conditions—see Section 3.5.
It is often convenient to visualize the motion of a dynamical system as an orbit, or
trajectory, in phase-space, which is defined as the space of all of the dynamical variables
required to specify the instantaneous state of the system. For the case in hand, there are
two dynamical variables, v and θ, and so phase-space corresponds to the θ-v plane. Note
that each different point in this plane corresponds to a unique instantaneous state of the
pendulum. [Strictly speaking, we should also consider t to be a dynamical variable, since
it appears explicitly on the right-hand side of Equation (15.11).]
It is clear, from Equations (15.15) and (15.16), that if we wait long enough for all of the
transients to decay away then the motion of the pendulum settles down to the following
simple orbit in phase-space:

As illustrated in Figure 15.2, this curve is an ellipse whose principal axes are aligned with
the v and θ coordinate axes. Observe that the curve is closed, which suggests that the
associated motion is periodic in time. In fact, the motion repeats itself exactly every
τ=

normalized time units. The maximum angular displacement of the pendulum from its
undriven rest position (θ = 0) is Ã. As illustrated in Figure 15.3, the variation of Ã
with driving frequency ω [see Equation (15.21)] displays all of the features of a classic
resonance curve. The maximum amplitude of the driven oscillation is proportional to
the quality-factor, Q, and is achieved when the driving frequency matches the natural
frequency of the pendulum (i.e., when |ω| = 1). Moreover, the width of the resonance in
ω-space is proportional to 1/Q—see Section 3.7.
The phase-space curve shown in Figure 15.2 is called a periodic attractor. It is termed
an “attractor” because, irrespective of the initial conditions, the trajectory of the system
in phase-space tends asymptotically to—in other words, is attracted to—this curve as
t → ∞. This gravitation of phase-space trajectories towards the attractor is illustrated
in Figures 15.4 and 15.5. Of course, the attractor is termed “periodic” because it corresponds to motion which is periodic in time.
Let us summarize our findings so far. We have discovered that if a damped pendulum is subject to a low amplitude periodic drive then its time-asymptotic response (i.e., its

response after any transients have died away) is periodic, with the same period as the driving torque. Moreover, the response exhibits resonant behaviour as the driving frequency
approaches the natural frequency of oscillation of the pendulum. The amplitude of the resonant response, as well as the width of the resonant window, is governed by the amount
of damping in the system. After a little reflection, we can easily appreciate that all of these
results are a direct consequence of the linearity of the pendulum’s equations of motion
in the low amplitude limit. In fact, it is easily demonstrated that the time-asymptotic response of any intrinsically stable linear system (with a discrete spectrum of normal modes)
to a periodic drive is periodic, with the same period as the drive. Moreover, if the driving frequency approaches one of the natural frequencies of oscillation of the system then
the response exhibits resonant behaviour. But, is this the only allowable time-asymptotic
response of a dynamical system to a periodic drive? It turns out that it is not. Indeed,
the response of a non-linear system to a periodic drive is generally much richer and far
more diverse than simple periodic motion. Since the majority of naturally occurring dynamical systems are non-linear, it is clearly important that we gain a basic understanding
of this phenomenon. Unfortunately, we cannot achieve this goal via a standard analytic
approach, since non-linear equations of motion generally do not possess simple analytic
solutions. Instead, we must employ numerical methods. As an example, let us investigate
the dynamics of a damped pendulum, subject to a periodic drive, with no restrictions on
the amplitude of the pendulum’s motion.

15.4 Numerical Solution
In the following, we present numerical solutions of Equations (15.10) and (15.11) obtained using a fairly standard fixed step-length fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration scheme.1

15.5 Poincaré Section
For the sake of definiteness, let us fix the normalized amplitude and frequency of the external drive to be A = 1.5 and ω = 2/3, respectively.2 Furthermore, let us investigate any
changes which may develop in the nature of the pendulum’s time-asymptotic motion as
the quality-factor Q is varied. Of course, if Q is made sufficiently small (i.e., if the pendulum is embedded in a sufficiently viscous medium) then we expect the amplitude of the
pendulum’s time-asymptotic motion to become low enough that the linear analysis outlined in Section 15.3 is valid. Indeed, we expect non-linear effects to manifest themselves
as Q is gradually made larger, and the amplitude of the pendulum’s motion consequently
increases to such an extent that the small angle approximation breaks down.

Figure 15.6 shows a time-asymptotic orbit in phase-space calculated numerically for
a case where Q is sufficiently small (i.e., Q = 1/2) that the small angle approximation
holds reasonably well. Not surprisingly, the orbit is very similar to the analytic orbits
described in Section 15.3. The fact that the orbit consists of a single loop, and forms a
closed curve in phase-space, strongly suggests that the corresponding motion is periodic
with the same period as the external drive—we term this type of motion period-1 motion.
More generally, period-n motion consists of motion which repeats itself exactly every n
periods of the external drive (and, obviously, does not repeat itself on any time-scale less
than n periods). Of course, period-1 motion is the only allowed time-asymptotic motion
in the small angle limit.
It would certainly be helpful to possess a graphical test for period-n motion. In fact,
such a test was developed more than a hundred years ago by the French mathematician
Henry Poincaré. Nowadays, it is called a Poincaré section in his honour. The idea of a
Poincaré section, as applied to a periodically driven pendulum, is very simple. As before,
we calculate the time-asymptotic motion of the pendulum, and visualize it as a series of
points in θ-v phase-space. However, we only plot one point per period of the external drive.
To be more exact, we only plot a point when
ω t = φ + k 2π

(15.23)

where k is any integer, and φ is referred to as the Poincaré phase. For period-1 motion, in
which the motion repeats itself exactly every period of the external drive, we expect the
Poincaré section to consist of only one point in phase-space (i.e., we expect all of the points
to plot on top of one another). Likewise, for period-2 motion, in which the motion repeats
itself exactly every two periods of the external drive, we expect the Poincaré section to
consist of two points in phase-space (i.e., we expect alternating points to plot on top of one
another). Finally, for period-n motion we expect the Poincaré section to consist of n points

in phase-space.
Figure 15.7 displays the Poincaré section of the orbit shown in Figure 15.6. The fact
that the section consists of a single point confirms that the motion displayed in Figure 15.6
is indeed period-1 motion.

15.6 Spatial Symmetry Breaking
Suppose that we now gradually increase the quality-factor Q. What happens to the simple
orbit shown in Figure 15.6? It turns out that, at first, nothing particularly exciting happens. The size of the orbit gradually increases, indicating a corresponding increase in the
amplitude of the pendulum’s motion, but the general nature of the motion remains unchanged. However, something interesting does occur when Q is increased beyond about
1.2. Figure 15.8 shows the v-coordinate of the orbit’s Poincaré section plotted against Q
in the range 1.2 and 1.3. Note the sharp downturn in the curve at Q ≃ 1.245. What does
this signify? Well, Figure 15.9 shows the time-asymptotic phase-space orbit just before the
downturn (i.e., at Q = 1.24), and Figure 15.10 shows the orbit somewhat after the downturn (i.e., at Q = 1.30). It is clear that the downturn is associated with a sudden change
in the nature of the pendulum’s time-asymptotic phase-space orbit. Prior to the downturn,
the orbit spends as much time in the region θ < 0 as in the region θ > 0. However, after
the downturn the orbit spends the majority of its time in the region θ < 0. In other words,
after the downturn, the pendulum bob favours the region to the left of the pendulum’s vertical. This is somewhat surprising, since there is nothing in the pendulum’s equations of
motion which differentiates between the regions to the left and to the right of the vertical.
We refer to a solution of this type—i.e., one which fails to realize the full symmetry of the
dynamical system in question—as a symmetry breaking solution. In this case, because the

particular symmetry which is broken is a spatial symmetry, we refer to the process by which
the symmetry breaking solution suddenly appears, as the control parameter Q is adjusted,
as spatial symmetry breaking. Needless to say, spatial symmetry breaking is an intrinsically
non-linear process—it cannot take place in dynamical systems possessing linear equations
of motion.
It stands to reason that since the pendulum’s equations of motion favour neither the left
nor the right then the left-favouring orbit pictured in Figure 15.10 must be accompanied
by a mirror image right-favouring orbit. How do we obtain this mirror image orbit? It
turns out that all we have to do is keep the physical parameters Q, A, and ω fixed, but
change the initial conditions θ(0) and v(0). Figure 15.11 shows a time-asymptotic phasespace orbit calculated with the same physical parameters used in Figure 15.10, but with
the initial conditions θ(0) = 0 and v(0) = −3, instead of θ(0) = 0 and v(0) = 0. It can be
seen that the orbit is indeed the mirror image of that pictured in Figure 15.10.
Figure 15.12 shows the v-coordinate of the Poincaré section of a time-asymptotic orbit,
calculated with the same physical parameters used in Figure 15.8, versus Q in the range
1.2 and 1.3. Data is shown for the two sets of initial conditions discussed above. The
figure is interpreted as follows. When Q is less than a critical value, which is about 1.245,
then the two sets of initial conditions lead to motions which converge on the same leftright symmetric period-1 attractor. However, once Q exceeds the critical value then the
attractor bifurcates into two asymmetric mirror image period-1 attractors. Obviously, the
bifurcation is indicated by the forking of the curve shown in Figure 15.12. The lower and
upper branches correspond to the left- and right-favouring attractors, respectively.
Spontaneous symmetry breaking, which is the fundamental non-linear process illustrated in the above discussion, plays an important role in many areas of physics. For
instance, symmetry breaking gives mass to elementary particles in the unified theory of

electromagnetic and weak interactions.3 Symmetry breaking also plays a pivotal role in
the so-called “inflation” theory of the expansion of the early universe.4

15.7 Basins of Attraction
We have seen that when Q = 1.3, A = 1.5, and ω = 2/3 there are two co-existing
period-1 attractors in θ–v phase-space. The time-asymptotic trajectory of the pendulum
through phase-space converges on one or other of these attractors depending on the initial
conditions: i.e., depending on the values of θ(0) and v(0). Let us define the basin of
attraction of a given attractor as the locus of all points in the θ(0)–v(0) plane which lead
to motion which ultimately converges on that attractor. We have seen that in the lowamplitude (i.e., linear) limit (see Section 15.3) there is only a single period-1 attractor
in phase-space, and all possible initial conditions lead to motion which converges on this
attractor. In other words, the basin of attraction for the low-amplitude attractor constitutes
the entire θ(0)–v(0) plane. The present case, in which there are two co-existing attractors
in phase-space, is somewhat more complicated.
Figure 15.13 shows the basins of attraction, in θ(0)–v(0) space, of the asymmetric
mirror image attractors pictured in Figures 15.10 and 15.11. The basin of attraction of
the left-favoring attractor shown in Figure 15.10 is coloured black, whereas the basin of
attraction of the right-favoring attractor shown in Figure 15.11 is coloured white. It can be
seen that the two basins form a complicated interlocking pattern. Since we can identify the
angles π and −π, the right-hand edge of the pattern connects smoothly with its left-hand
edge. In fact, we can think of the pattern as existing on the surface of a cylinder.
Suppose that we take a diagonal from the bottom left-hand corner of Figure 15.13
to its top right-hand corner. This diagonal is intersected by a number of black bands of
varying thickness. Observe that the two narrowest bands (i.e., the fourth band from the
bottom left-hand corner and the second band from the upper right-hand corner) both
exhibit structure which is not very well resolved in the present picture.
Figure 15.14 is a blow-up of a region close to the lower left-hand corner of Figure 15.13.

Figure 15.16 is a blow-up of a region of Figure 15.15. It can be seen that the unresolved
band in the latter figure (i.e., the first, second, and third bands from the right-hand side
in the former figure) actually consists of a closely spaced triplet of bands. Note, however,
that the narrowest of these bands exhibits structure which is not very well resolved in the
present picture.
It should be clear, by this stage, that no matter how closely we look at Figure 15.13 we
are going to find structure which we cannot resolve. In other words, the separatrix between
the two basins of attraction shown in this figure is a curve which exhibits structure at all
scales. Mathematicians have a special term for such a curve—they call it a fractal.5
Many people think of fractals as mathematical toys whose principal use is the generation of pretty pictures. However, it turns out that there is a close connection between fractals and the dynamics of non-linear systems—particularly systems which exhibit chaotic
dynamics. We have just seen an example in which the boundary between the basins of
attraction of two co-existing attractors in phase-space is a fractal curve. This turns out to
be a fairly general result: i.e., when multiple attractors exist in phase-space the separatrix
between their various basins of attraction is invariably fractal. What is this telling us about
the nature of non-linear dynamics? Well, returning to Figure 15.13, we can see that in the
region of phase-space in which the fractal behaviour of the separatrix manifests itself most
strongly (i.e., the region where the light and dark bands fragment) the system exhibits
abnormal sensitivity to initial conditions. In other words, we only have to change the initial conditions slightly (i.e., so as to move from a dark to a light band, or vice versa) in
order to significantly alter the time-asymptotic motion of the pendulum (i.e., to cause the
system to converge to a left-favouring instead of a right-favouring attractor, or vice versa).
Fractals and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions are themes which will reoccur in our
investigation of non-linear dynamics.

15.8 Period-Doubling Bifurcations
Let us now return to Figure 15.8. Recall, that as the quality-factor Q is gradually increased,
the time-asymptotic orbit of the pendulum through phase-space undergoes a sudden transition, at Q ≃ 1.245, from a left-right symmetric period-1 orbit to a left-favouring period-1
orbit. What happens if we continue to increase Q? Figure 15.17 is basically a continuation
of Figure 15.8. It can be seen that as Q is increased the left-favouring period-1 orbit gradually evolves until a critical value of Q, which is about 1.348, is reached. When Q exceeds
this critical value the nature of the orbit undergoes another sudden change: this time from
a left-favouring period-1 orbit to a left-favouring period-2 orbit. Obviously, the change is
indicated by the forking of the curve in Figure 15.17. This type of transition is termed a
period-doubling bifurcation, since it involves a sudden doubling of the repetition period of
the pendulum’s time-asymptotic motion.
We can represent period-1 motion schematically as AAAAAA · · ·, where A represents
a pattern of motion which is repeated every period of the external drive. Likewise, we

can represent period-2 motion as ABABAB · · ·, where A and B represent distinguishable
patterns of motion which are repeated every alternate period of the external drive. A
period-doubling bifurcation is represented: AAAAAA · · · → ABABAB · · ·. Clearly, all
that happens in such a bifurcation is that the pendulum suddenly decides to do something
slightly different in alternate periods of the external drive.
Figure 15.18 shows the time-asymptotic phase-space orbit of the pendulum calculated
for a value of Q somewhat higher than that required to trigger the above mentioned
period-doubling bifurcation. It can be seen that the orbit is left-favouring (i.e., it spends
the majority of its time on the left-hand side of the plot), and takes the form of a closed
curve consisting of two interlocked loops in phase-space. Recall that for period-1 orbits
there was only a single closed loop in phase-space. Figure 15.19 shows the Poincaré section of the orbit shown in Figure 15.18. The fact that the section consists of two points
confirms that the orbit does indeed correspond to period-2 motion.
A period-doubling bifurcation is an example of temporal symmetry breaking. The equations of motion of the pendulum are invariant under the transformation t → t + τ, where
τ is the period of the external drive. In the low amplitude (i.e., linear) limit, the timeasymptotic motion of the pendulum always respects this symmetry. However, as we have
just seen, in the non-linear regime it is possible to obtain solutions which spontaneously
break this symmetry. Obviously, motion which repeats itself every two periods of the external drive is not as temporally symmetric as motion which repeats every period of the
drive.
Figure 15.20 is essentially a continuation of Fig 15.12. Data is shown for two sets of
initial conditions which lead to motions converging on left-favouring (lower branch) and
right-favouring (upper branch) periodic attractors. We have already seen that the leftfavouring periodic attractor undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation at Q = 1.348. It is

clear from Figure 15.20 that the right-favouring attractor undergoes a similar bifurcation
at almost exactly the same Q-value. This is hardly surprising since, as has already been
mentioned, for fixed physical parameters (i.e., Q, A, ω), the left- and right-favouring
attractors are mirror-images of one another.

15.9 Route to Chaos
Let us return to Figure 15.17, which tracks the evolution of a left-favouring periodic attractor as the quality-factor Q is gradually increased. Recall that when Q exceeds a critical
value, which is about 1.348, then the attractor undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation
which converts it from a period-1 to a period-2 attractor. This bifurcation is indicated by
the forking of the curve in Figure 15.17. Let us now investigate what happens as we continue to increase Q. Figure 15.21 is basically a continuation of Figure 15.17. It can be seen
that, as Q is gradually increased, the attractor undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation at
Q = 1.348, as before, but then undergoes a second period-doubling bifurcation (indicated
by the second forking of the curves) at Q ≃ 1.370, and a third bifurcation at Q ≃ 1.375.
Obviously, the second bifurcation converts a period-2 attractor into a period-4 attractor
(hence, two curves split apart to give four curves). Likewise, the third bifurcation converts
a period-4 attractor into a period-8 attractor (hence, four curves split into eight curves).
Shortly after the third bifurcation, the various curves in the figure seem to expand explosively and merge together to produce an area of almost solid black. As we shall see, this
behaviour is indicative of the onset of chaos.
Figure 15.22 is a blow-up of Figure 15.21, showing more details of the onset of chaos.

against the quality-factor Q. Data calculated numerically for A = 1.5, ω = 2/3, θ(0) = 0,
v(0) = 0, and φ = 0.
The period-4 to period-8 bifurcation can be seen quite clearly. However, we can also see a
period-8 to period-16 bifurcation, at Q ≃ 1.3755. Finally, if we look carefully, we can see a
hint of a period-16 to period-32 bifurcation, just before the start of the solid black region.
Figures 15.21 and 15.22 seem to suggest that the onset of chaos is triggered by an infinite
series of period-doubling bifurcations.
Table 15.1 gives some details of the sequence of period-doubling bifurcations shown in
Figures 15.21 and 15.22. Let us introduce a bifurcation index n: the period-1 to period2 bifurcation corresponds to n = 1; the period-2 to period-4 bifurcation corresponds to
n = 2; and so on. Let Qn be the critical value of the quality-factor Q at which the nth
bifurcation is triggered. Table 15.1 shows the Qn , determined from Figures 15.21 and
15.22, for n = 1 to 5. Also shown is the ratio
Fn =

Qn−1 − Qn−2
Qn − Qn−1

(15.24)

for n = 3 to 5. It can be seen that Table 15.1 offers reasonably convincing evidence that
this ratio takes the constant value F = 4.69. It follows that we can estimate the critical
Q-value required to trigger the nth bifurcation via the following formula:

Note that our calculated accumulation point corresponds almost exactly to the onset of
the solid black region in Figure 15.22. By the time that Q exceeds Q∞ , we expect the
attractor to have been converted into a period-infinity attractor via an infinite series of
period-doubling bifurcations. A period-infinity attractor is one whose corresponding motion never repeats itself, no matter how long we wait. In dynamics, such bounded aperiodic
motion is generally referred to as chaos. Hence, a period-infinity attractor is sometimes
called a chaotic attractor. Now, period-n motion is represented by n separate curves in
Figure 15.22. It is, therefore, not surprising that chaos (i.e., period-infinity motion) is represented by an infinite number of curves which merge together to form a region of solid
black.
Let us examine the onset of chaos in a little more detail. Figures 15.23–15.26 show
details of the pendulum’s time-asymptotic motion at various stages on the period-doubling
cascade discussed above. Figure 15.23 shows period-4 motion: note that the Poincaré
section consists of four points, and the associated sequence of net rotations per period
of the pendulum repeats itself every four periods. Figure 15.24 shows period-8 motion:
now the Poincaré section consists of eight points, and the rotation sequence repeats itself
every eight periods. Figure 15.25 shows period-16 motion: as expected, the Poincaré

section consists of sixteen points, and the rotation sequence repeats itself every sixteen
periods. Finally, Figure 15.26 shows chaotic motion. Note that the Poincaré section now
consists of a set of four continuous line segments, which are, presumably, made up of an
infinite number of points (corresponding to the infinite period of chaotic motion). Note,
also, that the associated sequence of net rotations per period shows no obvious sign of ever
repeating itself. In fact, this sequence looks rather like one of the previously shown periodic
sequences with the addition of a small random component. The generation of apparently
random motion from equations of motion, such as Equations (15.10) and (15.11), which
contain no overtly random elements is one of the most surprising features of non-linear
dynamics.
Many non-linear dynamical systems found in nature exhibit a transition from periodic
to chaotic motion as some control parameter is varied. Moreover, there are various known
mechanisms by which chaotic motion can arise from periodic motion. A transition to chaos
via an infinite series of period-doubling bifurcations, as illustrated above, is one of the most
commonly occurring mechanisms. Around 1975, the physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum was
investigating a simple mathematical model, known as the logistic map, which exhibits a
transition to chaos, via a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations, as a control parameter r
is increased. Let rn be the value of r at which the first 2n -period cycle appears. Feigenbaum

noticed that the ratio
Fn =

rn−1 − rn−2
rn − rn−1

(15.27)

converges rapidly to a constant value, F = 4.669, as n increases. Feigenbaum was able
to demonstrate that this value of F is common to a wide range of different mathematic
models which exhibit transitions to chaos via period-doubling bifurcations.6 Feigenbaum
went on to argue that the Feigenbaum ratio, Fn , should converge to the value 4.669 in
any dynamical system exhibiting a transition to chaos via period-doubling bifurcations.7
This amazing prediction has been verified experimentally in a number of quite different
physical systems.8 Note that our best estimate of the Feigenbaum ratio (see Table 15.1) is
4.69 ± 0.01, in good agreement with Feigenbaum’s prediction.
The existence of a universal ratio characterizing the transition to chaos via perioddoubling bifurcations is one of many pieces of evidence indicating that chaos is a universal
phenomenon (i.e., the onset and nature of chaotic motion in different dynamical systems
has many common features). This observation encourages us to believe that in studying
the chaotic motion of a damped periodically driven pendulum we are learning lessons
which can be applied to a wide range of non-linear dynamical systems.

Sensitivity to Initial Conditions

Suppose that we launch our pendulum and then wait until its motion has converged onto
a particular attractor. The subsequent motion can be visualized as a trajectory θ0 (t), v0 (t)

through phase-space. Suppose that we then somehow perturb the pendulum, at time
t = t0 , such that its position in phase-space is instantaneously changed from θ0 (t0), v0 (t0)
to θ0 (t0 )+δθ0 , v0 (t0)+δv0 . The subsequent motion can be visualized as a second trajectory
θ1 (t), v1 (t) through phase-space. What is the relationship between the original trajectory
θ0 (t), v0 (t) and the perturbed trajectory θ1 (t), v1 (t)? In particular, does the phase-space
separation between the two trajectories, whose components are
δθ(∆t) = θ1 (t0 + ∆t) − θ0 (t0 + ∆t),

δv(∆t) = v1 (t0 + ∆t) − v0 (t0 + ∆t),

(15.29)

grow in time, decay in time, or stay more or less the same? What we are really investigating
is how sensitive the time-asymptotic motion of the pendulum is to initial conditions.
According to the linear analysis of Section 15.3,

assuming sin(ω∗ t0 ) = 0. It is clear that, in the linear regime, at least, the pendulum’s timeasymptotic motion is not particularly sensitive to initial conditions. In fact, if we move the
pendulum’s phase-space trajectory slightly off the linear attractor, as described above, then
the perturbed trajectory decays back to the attractor exponentially in time. In other words,
if we wait long enough then the perturbed and unperturbed motions of the pendulum
become effectively indistinguishable. Let us now investigate whether this insensitivity to
initial conditions carries over into the non-linear regime.
Figures 15.27–15.30 show the results of the experiment described above, in which the
pendulum’s phase-space trajectory is moved slightly off an attractor and the phase-space
separation between the perturbed and unperturbed trajectories is then monitored as a
function of time, at various stages on the period-doubling cascade discussed in the previous
section. To be more exact, the figures show the logarithm of the absolute magnitude of
the v-component of the phase-space separation between the perturbed and unperturbed
trajectories as a function of normalized time.
Figure 15.27 shows the time evolution of the v-component of the phase-space separation, δv, between two neighbouring trajectories, one of which is the period-4 attractor
illustrated in Figure 15.23. It can be seen that δv decays rapidly in time. In fact, the graph
of log(|δv|) versus ∆t can be plausibly represented as a straight-line of gradient λ. In other
words,
|δv(∆t)| ≃ δv0 e λ ∆t ,
(15.32)

where the quantity λ is known as the Liapunov exponent, and is obviously negative. Clearly,
in this case, λ measures the strength of the exponential convergence of the two trajectories

in phase-space. Of course, the graph of log(|δv|) versus ∆t is not exactly a straight-line.
There are deviations due to the fact that δv oscillates, as well as decays, in time. There
are also deviations because the strength of the exponential convergence between the two
trajectories varies along the attractor.
The above definition of the Liapunov exponent is rather inexact, for two main reasons. In the first place, the strength of the exponential convergence/divergence between
two neighbouring trajectories in phase-space, one of which is an attractor, generally varies
along the attractor. Hence, we should really take formula (15.32) and somehow average
it over the attractor, in order to obtain a more unambiguous definition of λ. In the second
place, since the dynamical system under investigation is a second-order system, it actually
possesses two different Liapunov exponents. Consider the evolution of an infinitesimal circle of perturbed initial conditions, centred on a point in phase-space lying on an attractor.
During its evolution, the circle will become distorted into an infinitesimal ellipse. Let δk ,
where k = 1, 2, denote the phase-space length of the kth principal axis of the ellipse. The
two Liapunov exponents, λ1 and λ2 , are defined via δk (∆t) ≃ δk (0) exp(λk ∆t). However,
for large ∆t, the diameter of the ellipse is effectively controlled by the Liapunov exponent
with the most positive real part. Hence, when we refer to the Liapunov exponent, λ, what
we generally mean is the Liapunov exponent with the most positive real part.
Figure 15.28 shows the time evolution of the v-component of the phase-space separation, δv, between two neighbouring trajectories, one of which is the period-8 attractor
illustrated in Figure 15.24. It can be seen that δv decays in time, though not as rapidly as
in Figure 15.27. Another way of saying this is that the Liapunov exponent of the periodic
attractor shown in Figure 15.24 is negative (i.e., it has a negative real part), but not as
negative as that of the periodic attractor shown in Figure 15.23.
Figure 15.29 shows the time evolution of the v-component of the phase-space separation, δv, between two neighbouring trajectories, one of which is the period-16 attractor
illustrated in Figure 15.25. It can be seen that δv decays weakly in time. In other words,
the Liapunov exponent of the periodic attractor shown in Figure 15.25 is small and negative.
Finally, Figure 15.30 shows the time evolution of the v-component of the phase-space
separation, δv, between two neighbouring trajectories, one of which is the chaotic attractor
illustrated in Figure 15.26. It can be seen that δv increases in time. In other words, the
Liapunov exponent of the chaotic attractor shown in Figure 15.26 is positive. Further
investigation reveals that, as the control parameter Q is gradually increased, the Liapunov
exponent changes sign and becomes positive at exactly the same point that chaos ensues
in Figure 15.22.
The above discussion strongly suggests that periodic attractors are characterized by
negative Liapunov exponents, whereas chaotic attractors are characterized by positive exponents. But, how can an attractor have a positive Liapunov exponent? Surely, a positive
exponent necessarily implies that neighbouring phase-space trajectories diverge from the
attractor (and, hence, that the attractor is not a true attractor)? It turns out that this is not
the case. The chaotic attractor shown in Figure 15.26 is a true attractor, in the sense that

The Chaotic Pendulum

265

neighbouring trajectories rapidly converge onto it—i.e., after a few periods of the external
drive their Poincaré sections plot out the same four-line segment shown in Figure 15.26.
Thus, the exponential divergence of neighbouring trajectories, characteristic of chaotic attractors, takes place within the attractor itself. Obviously, this exponential divergence must
come to an end when the phase-space separation of the trajectories becomes comparable
to the extent of the attractor.
A dynamical system characterized by a positive Liapunov exponent, λ, has a time horizon beyond which regular deterministic prediction breaks down. Suppose that we measure
the initial conditions of an experimental system very accurately. Obviously, no measurement is perfect: there is always some error δ0 between our estimate and the true initial
state. After a time t, the discrepancy grows to δ(t) ∼ δ0 exp(λ t). Let a be a measure of our
tolerance: i.e., a prediction within a of the true state is considered acceptable. It follows
that our prediction becomes unacceptable when δ ≫ a, which occurs when
t > th ∼

Note the logarithmic dependence on δ0 . This ensures that, in practice, no matter how hard
we work to reduce our initial measurement error, we cannot predict the behaviour of the
system for longer than a few multiples of 1/λ.
It follows, from the above discussion, that chaotic attractors are associated with motion
which is essentially unpredictable. In other words, if we attempt to integrate the equations
of motion of a chaotic system then even the slightest error made in the initial conditions
will be amplified exponentially over time, and will rapidly destroy the accuracy of our
prediction. Eventually, all that we will be able to say is that the motion lies somewhere on
the chaotic attractor in phase-space, but exactly where it lies on the attractor at any given
time will be unknown to us.
The hyper-sensitivity of chaotic systems to initial conditions is sometimes called the butterfly effect. The idea is that a butterfly flapping its wings in a South American rain-forest
could, in principle, affect the weather in Texas (since the atmosphere exhibits chaotic
dynamics). This idea was first publicized by the meteorologist Edward Lorenz, who constructed a very crude model of the convection of the atmosphere when it is heated from
below by the ground.9 Lorenz discovered, much to his surprise, that his model atmosphere
exhibited chaotic motion—which, at that time, was virtually unknown. In fact, Lorenz was
essentially the first scientist to fully understand the nature and ramifications of chaotic
motion in physical systems. In particular, Lorenz realized that the chaotic dynamics of the
atmosphere spells the doom of long-term weather forecasting: the best one can hope to
achieve is to predict the weather a few days in advance (1/λ for the atmosphere is of order
a few days).

Definition of Chaos

There is no universally agreed definition of chaos. However, most people would accept the
following working definition:
Chaos is aperiodic time-asymptotic behaviour in a deterministic system which
exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
This definition contains three main elements:
1. Aperiodic time-asymptotic behaviour—this implies the existence of phase-space trajectories which do not settle down to fixed points or periodic orbits. For practical
reasons, we insist that these trajectories are not too rare. We also require the trajectories to be bounded: i.e., they should not go off to infinity.
2. Deterministic—this implies that the equations of motion of the system possess no
random inputs. In other words, the irregular behaviour of the system arises from
non-linear dynamics, and not from noisy driving forces.
3. Sensitive dependence on initial conditions—this implies that nearby trajectories in
phase-space separate exponentially fast in time: i.e., that the system has a positive
Liapunov exponent.

15.12

Periodic Windows

Let us return to Figure 15.22. Recall, that this figure shows the onset of chaos, via a
cascade of period-doubling bifurcations, as the quality-factor Q is gradually increased.
Figure 15.31 is essentially a continuation of Figure 15.22 which shows the full extent of
the chaotic region (in Q-v space). It can be seen that the chaotic region ends abruptly
when Q exceeds a critical value, which is about 1.4215. Beyond this critical value, the
time-asymptotic motion appears to revert to period-1 motion (i.e., the solid black region
collapses to a single curve). It can also be seen that the chaotic region contains many
narrow windows in which chaos reverts to periodic motion (i.e., the solid black region
collapses to n curves, where n is the period of the motion) for a short interval in Q. The
four widest windows are indicated in the figure.
Figure 15.32 is a blow-up of the period-3 window shown in Figure 15.31. It can be
seen that the window appears “out of the blue” as Q is gradually increased. However, it
can also be seen that, as Q is further increased, the window breaks down, and eventually
disappears, due to the action of a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations. The same
basic mechanism operates here as in the original period-doubling cascade, discussed in
Section 15.9, except that now the orbits are of period 3 · 2n , instead of 2 · 2n . Note that all
of the other periodic windows seen in Figure 15.31 break down in an analogous manner,
as Q is increased.

We now understand how periodic windows break down. But, how do they appear in the
first place? Figures 15.33–15.35 show details of the pendulum’s time-asymptotic motion
calculated just before the appearance of the period-3 window (shown in Figure 15.32), just
at the appearance of the window, and just after the appearance of the window, respectively.
It can be seen, from Figure 15.33, that just before the appearance of the window the
attractor is chaotic (i.e., its Poincaré section consists of a line, rather than a discrete set of
points), and the time-asymptotic motion of the pendulum consists of intervals of period-3
motion interspersed with intervals of chaotic motion. Figure 15.34 shows that just at the
appearance of the window the attractor loses much of its chaotic nature (i.e., its Poincaré
section breaks up into a series of points), and the chaotic intervals become shorter and
much less frequent. Finally, Figure 15.35 shows that just after the appearance of the
window the attractor collapses to a period-3 attractor, and the chaotic intervals cease
altogether. All of the other periodic windows seen in Figure 15.31 appear in an analogous
manner to that just described.
According to the above discussion, the typical time-asymptotic motion seen just prior to
the appearance of a period-n window consists of intervals of period-n motion interspersed
with intervals of chaotic motion. This type of behaviour is called intermittency, and is
observed in a wide variety of non-linear systems. As we move away from the window,
in parameter space, the intervals of periodic motion become gradually shorter and more
infrequent. Eventually, they cease altogether. Likewise, as we move towards the window,
the intervals of periodic motion become gradually longer and more frequent. Eventually,
the whole motion becomes periodic.
In 1973, Metropolis and co-workers investigated a class of simple mathematical models
which all exhibit a transition to chaos, via a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations, as
some control parameter r is increased.10 They were able to demonstrate that, for these

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

models, the order in which stable periodic orbits occur as r is increased is fixed. That is,
stable periodic attractors always occur in the same sequence as r is varied. This sequence
is called the universal or U-sequence. It is possible to make a fairly convincing argument
that any physical system which exhibits a transition to chaos via a sequence of perioddoubling bifurcations should also exhibit the U-sequence of stable periodic attractors. Up
to period-6, the U-sequence is
1, 2, 2 × 2, 6, 5, 3, 2 × 3, 5, 6, 4, 6, 5, 6.
The beginning of this sequence is familiar: periods 1, 2, 2 × 2 are the first stages of the
period-doubling cascade. (The later period-doublings give rise to periods greater than 6,
and so are omitted here). The next periods, 6, 5, 3 correspond to the first three periodic
windows shown in Figure 15.31. Period 2 × 3 is the first component of the period-doubling
cascade which breaks up the period-3 window. The next period, 5, corresponds to the last
periodic window shown in Figure 15.31. The remaining periods, 6, 4, 6, 5, 6, correspond
to tiny periodic windows, which, in practice, are virtually impossible to observe. It follows
that our driven pendulum system exhibits the U-sequence of stable periodic orbits fairly
convincingly. This sequence has also been observed experimentally in other, quite different, dynamical systems.11 The existence of a universal sequence of stable periodic orbits
in dynamical systems which exhibit a transition to chaos via a cascade of period-doubling
bifurcations is another indication that chaos is a universal phenomenon.

15.13

Further Investigation

Figure 15.36 shows the complete bifurcation diagram for the damped, periodically driven,
pendulum (with A = 1.5 and ω = 2/3). It can be seen that the chaotic region investigated
in the previous section is, in fact, the first, and least extensive, of three different chaotic
regions.
The interval between the first and second chaotic regions is occupied by the period1 orbits shown in Figure 15.37. Note that these orbits differ somewhat from previously
encountered period-1 orbits in that the pendulum executes a complete rotation (either to
the left or to the right) every period of the external drive. Now, an n, l periodic orbit is
defined such that
θ(t + n τ) = θ(t) + 2π l
for all t (after the transients have died away). It follows that all of the periodic orbits
which we encountered in previous sections were l = 0 orbits: i.e., their associated motions
did not involve a net rotation of the pendulum. The orbits show in Figure 15.37 are
n = 1, l = −1 and n = 1, l = +1 orbits, respectively. The existence of periodic orbits in
which the pendulum undergoes a net rotation, either to the left or to the right, is another
example of spatial symmetry breaking—there is nothing in the pendulum’s equations of
motion which distinguishes between the two possible directions of rotation.

Figure 15.38 shows the Poincaré section of a typical attractor in the second chaotic
region shown in Figure 15.36. It can be seen that this attractor is far more convoluted
and extensive than the simple 4-line chaotic attractor pictured in Figure 15.26. In fact,
the attractor shown in Figure 15.38 is clearly a fractal curve. It turns out that virtually all
chaotic attractors exhibit fractal structure.
The interval between the second and third chaotic regions shown in Figure 15.36 is
occupied by n = 3, l = 0 periodic orbits. Figure 15.39 shows the Poincaré section of a
typical attractor in the third chaotic region. It can be seen that this attractor is even more
overtly fractal in nature than that pictured in the previous figure. Note that the fractal
nature of chaotic attractors is closely associated with some of their unusual properties.
Trajectories on a chaotic attractor remain confined to a bounded region of phase-space,
and yet they separate from their neighbours exponentially fast (at least, initially). How
can trajectories diverge endlessly and still stay bounded? The basic mechanism is described
below. If we imagine a blob of initial conditions in phase-space then these undergo a series
of repeated stretching and folding episodes, as the chaotic motion unfolds. The stretching is
what gives rise to the divergence of neighbouring trajectories. The folding is what ensures
that the trajectories remain bounded. The net result is a phase-space structure which looks
a bit like filo pastry—in other words, a fractal structure.

A Vector Algebra and Vector Calculus

A.1 Introduction
This appendix contains a brief outline of vector algebra and vector calculus. The essential
purpose of vector algebra is to convert the propositions of Euclidean geometry in threedimensional space into a convenient algebraic form. Vector calculus allows us to define the
instantaneous velocity and acceleration of a moving object in three-dimensional space, as
well as the work done when such an object travels along a general curved trajectory in a
force field. Vector calculus also introduces the concept of a scalar field: e.g., the potential
energy associated with a conservative force field.

A.2 Scalars and Vectors
Many physical quantities (e.g., mass, energy) are entirely defined by a numerical magnitude (in appropriate units). Such quantities, which have no directional element, are
known as scalars. Moreover, since scalars can be represented by real numbers, it follows
that they obey the familiar laws of ordinary algebra. However, there exits a second class
of physical quantities (e.g., velocity, acceleration, force) which are only completely defined
when both a numerical magnitude and a direction in space is specified. Such quantities
are known as vectors. By definition, a vector obeys the same algebra as a displacement
→
in space, and may thus be represented geometrically by a straight-line, PQ (say), where
the arrow indicates the direction of the displacement (i.e., from point P to point Q)—see
Figure A.1. The magnitude of the vector is represented by the length of the straight-line.
It is conventional to denote vectors by bold-faced symbols (e.g., a, F) and scalars by
non-bold-faced symbols (e.g., r, S). The magnitude of a general vector, a, is denoted |a|,
or just a, and is, by definition, always greater than or equal to zero. It is convenient to
define a vector with zero magnitude—this is denoted 0, and has no direction. Finally, two
vectors, a and b, are said to be equal when their magnitudes and directions are identical.

Suppose that the displacements PQ and QR represent the vectors a and b, respectively—
see Figure A.2. It can be seen that the result of combining these two displacements is to

give the net displacement PR. Hence, if PR represents the vector c then we can write
c = a + b.

(A.1)

This defines vector addition. By completing the parallelogram PQRS, we can also see that

PR = PQ + QR = PS + SR .
(A.2)

However, PS has the same length and direction as QR, and, thus, represents the same
→
→
vector, b. Likewise, PQ and SR both represent the vector a. Thus, the above equation is
equivalent to
c = a + b = b + a.
(A.3)
We conclude that the addition of vectors is commutative. It can also be shown that the
associative law holds: i.e.,
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c.
(A.4)
The null vector, 0, is represented by a displacement of zero length and arbitrary direction. Since the result of combining such a displacement with a finite length displacement
is the same as the latter displacement by itself, it follows that
a + 0 = a,

(A.5)

where a is a general vector. The negative of a is defined as that vector which has the same
magnitude, but acts in the opposite direction, and is denoted −a. The sum of a and −a is
thus the null vector: i.e.,
a + (−a) = 0.

We can also define the difference of two vectors, a and b, as
c = a − b = a + (−b).

(A.7)

This definition of vector subtraction is illustrated in Figure A.3.
If n > 0 is a scalar then the expression n a denotes a vector whose direction is the
same as a, and whose magnitude is n times that of a. (This definition becomes obvious
when n is an integer.) If n is negative then, since n a = |n| (−a), it follows that n a is a
vector whose magnitude is |n| times that of a, and whose direction is opposite to a. These
definitions imply that if n and m are two scalars then
n (m a) = n m a = m (n a),

(A.8)

(n + m) a = n a + m a,

(A.9)

n (a + b) = n a + n b.

A.4 Cartesian Components of a Vector
Consider a Cartesian coordinate system Oxyz consisting of an origin, O, and three mutually perpendicular coordinate axes, Ox, Oy, and Oz—see Figure A.4. Such a system is said
to be right-handed if, when looking along the Oz direction, a 90◦ clockwise rotation about
Oz is required to take Ox into Oy. Otherwise, it is said to be left-handed. In physics, it is
conventional to always use right-handed coordinate systems.
It is convenient to define unit vectors, ex , ey , and ez , parallel to Ox, Oy, and Oz,
respectively. Incidentally, a unit vector is a vector whose magnitude is unity. The position
vector, r, of some general point P whose Cartesian coordinates are (x, y, z) is then given
by
r = x ez + y ey + z ez .
(A.11)
In other words, we can get from O to P by moving a distance x parallel to Ox, then
a distance y parallel to Oy, and then a distance z parallel to Oz. Similarly, if a is an
arbitrary vector then
a = ax ex + ay ey + az ez ,

where ax , ay , and az are termed the Cartesian components of a. It is coventional to write
a ≡ (ax , ay , az ). It follows that ex ≡ (1, 0, 0), ey ≡ (0, 1, 0), and ez ≡ (0, 0, 1). Of course,
0 ≡ (0, 0, 0).
According to the three-dimensional generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, the
distance OP ≡ |r| = r is given by
r=

x2 + y2 + z2 .

(A.13)

By analogy, the magnitude of a general vector a takes the form
a=

q

ax2 + ay2 + az2 .

(A.14)

If a ≡ (ax , ay , az ) and b ≡ (bx , by , bz ) then it is easily demonstrated that
a + b ≡ (ax + bx , ay + by , az + bz ).

(A.15)

Furthermore, if n is a scalar then it is apparent that
n a ≡ (n ax , n ay , n az ).

(A.16)

A.5 Coordinate Transformations
A Cartesian coordinate system allows position and direction in space to be represented in a
very convenient manner. Unfortunately, such a coordinate system also introduces arbitrary
elements into our analysis. After all, two independent observers might well choose coordinate systems with different origins, and different orientations of the coordinate axes. In
general, a given vector a will have different sets of components in these two coordinate
systems. However, the direction and magnitude of a are the same in both cases. Hence,
the two sets of components must be related to one another in a very particular fashion. Actually, since vectors are represented by moveable line elements in space (i.e., in Figure A.2,
→
→
PQ and SR represent the same vector), it follows that the components of a general vector

are not affected by a simple shift in the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. On the
other hand, the components are modified when the coordinate axes are rotated.
Suppose that we transform to a new coordinate system, Ox ′ y ′ z ′ , which has the same
origin as Oxyz, and is obtained by rotating the coordinate axes of Oxyz through an angle
θ about Oz—see Figure A.5. Let the coordinates of a general point P be (x, y, z) in Oxyz
and (x ′ , y ′ , z ′ ) in Ox ′ y ′ z ′ . According to simple trigonometry, these two sets of coordinates
are related to one another via the transformation:
x ′ = x cos θ + y sin θ,

(A.17)

y ′ = −x sin θ + y cos θ,

(A.18)

z ′ = z.

(A.19)

→
Consider the vector displacement r ≡ OP. Note that this displacement is represented by
the same symbol, r, in both coordinate systems, since the magnitude and direction of r are
manifestly independent of the orientation of the coordinate axes. The coordinates of r do
depend on the orientation of the axes: i.e., r ≡ (x, y, z) in Oxyz, and r ≡ (x ′ , y ′ , z ′ ) in
Ox ′ y ′ z ′ . However, they must depend in a very specific manner [i.e., Equations (A.17)–
(A.19)] which preserves the magnitude and direction of r.
The components of a general vector a transform in an analogous manner to Equations (A.17)–(A.19): i.e.,
ax ′ = ax cos θ + ay sin θ,

(A.20)

ay ′ = −ax sin θ + ay cos θ,

(A.21)

az ′ = az .

(A.22)

Moreover, there are similar transformation rules for rotation about Ox and Oy. Equations (A.20)–(A.22) effectively constitute the definition of a vector: i.e., the three quantities
(ax , ay , az ) are the components of a vector provided that they transform under rotation
of the coordinate axes about Oz in accordance with Equations (A.20)–(A.22). (And also
transform correctly under rotation about Ox and Oy). Conversely, (ax , ay , az ) cannot be

280

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

the components of a vector if they do not transform in accordance with Equations (A.20)–
(A.22). Of course, scalar quantities are invariant under rotation of the coordinate axes.
Thus, the individual components of a vector (ax , say) are real numbers, but they are not
scalars. Displacement vectors, and all vectors derived from displacements (e.g., velocity,
acceleration), automatically satisfy Equations (A.20)–(A.22). There are, however, other
physical quantities which have both magnitude and direction, but which are not obviously
related to displacements. We need to check carefully to see whether these quantities are
really vectors (see Section A.8).

A.6 Scalar Product
A scalar quantity is invariant under all possible rotational transformations. The individual
components of a vector are not scalars because they change under transformation. Can
we form a scalar out of some combination of the components of one, or more, vectors?
Suppose that we were to define the “percent” product,
a % b ≡ ax bz + ay bx + az by = scalar number,

(A.23)

for general vectors a and b. Is a % b invariant under transformation, as must be the case
if it is a scalar number? Let us consider an example. Suppose that a ≡ (0, 1, 0) and b ≡
◦
(1, 0, 0). It is easily seen that a % b = 1. Let us now
√ rotate
√ the coordinate axes
√ through
√ 45
about Oz. In the new coordinate system, a ≡ (1/ 2, 1/ 2, 0) and b ≡ (1/ 2, −1/ 2, 0),
giving a % b = 1/2. Clearly, a % b is not invariant under rotational transformation, so the
above definition is a bad one.
Consider, now, the dot product or scalar product:
a · b ≡ ax bx + ay by + az bz = scalar number.

(A.24)

Let us rotate the coordinate axes though θ degrees about Oz. According to Equations (A.20)–
(A.22), a · b takes the form
a · b = (ax cos θ + ay sin θ) (bx cos θ + by sin θ)
+(−ax sin θ + ay cos θ) (−bx sin θ + by cos θ) + az bz
= ax bx + ay by + az bz

(A.25)

in the new coordinate system. Thus, a · b is invariant under rotation about Oz. It can easily
be shown that it is also invariant under rotation about Ox and Oy. We conclude that a · b
is a true scalar, and that the above definition is a good one. Incidentally, a · b is the only
simple combination of the components of two vectors which transforms like a scalar. It is
easily shown that the dot product is commutative and distributive: i.e.,
a · b = b · a,

a · (b + c) = a · b + a · c.

Figure A.6: A vector triangle.
The associative property is meaningless for the dot product, because we cannot have (a ·
b) · c, since a · b is scalar.
We have shown that the dot product a · b is coordinate independent. But what is the
geometric significance of this? Well, in the special case where a = b, we get
a · b = ax2 + ay2 + az2 = |a|2 = a2 .

(A.27)

(b − a) · (b − a) = |a|2 + |b|2 − 2 a · b.

(A.28)

(AB)2 = (OA)2 + (OB)2 − 2 (OA) (OB) cos θ,

(A.29)

So, the invariance of a·a is equivalent to the invariance of the magnitude of vector a under
transformation.
Let us now investigate the general case. The length squared of AB in the vector triangle
shown in Figure A.6 is
However, according to the “cosine rule” of trigonometry,

where (AB) denotes the length of side AB. It follows that
a · b = |a| |b| cos θ.

(A.30)

In this case, the invariance of a · b under transformation is equivalent to the invariance of
the angle subtended between the two vectors. Note that if a · b = 0 then either |a| = 0,
|b| = 0, or the vectors a and b are mutually perpendicular. The angle subtended between
two vectors can easily be obtained from the dot product: i.e.,
cos θ =

a·b
.
|a| |b|

(A.31)

The work W performed by a constant force F which moves an object through a displacement r is the product of the magnitude of F times the displacement in the direction
of F. If the angle subtended between F and r is θ then
W = |F| (|r| cos θ) = F · r.

(A.32)

The work dW performed by a non-constant force f which moves an object through
an infinitesimal displacement dr in a time interval dt is dW = f · dr. Thus, the rate at
which the force does work on the object, which is usually referred to as the power, is
P = dW/dt = f · dr/dt, or P = f · v, where v = dr/dt is the object’s instantaneous velocity.

A.7 Vector Product
We have discovered how to construct a scalar from the components of two general vectors
a and b. Can we also construct a vector which is not just a linear combination of a and b?

Is a ∗ b a proper vector? Suppose that a = (0, 1, 0), b = (1, 0, 0). In this case,
b = 0.

b = (1/ 2, −1/ 2, 0), and a ∗ b = (1/2, −1/2, 0). Thus, a ∗ b does not transform like a
vector, because its magnitude depends on the choice of axes. So, above definition is a bad
one.
Consider, now, the cross product or vector product:
a × b ≡ (ay bz − az by , az bx − ax bz , ax by − ay bx ) = c.

(A.34)

Does this rather unlikely combination transform like a vector? Let us try rotating the
coordinate axes through an angle θ about Oz using Equations (A.20)–(A.22). In the new
coordinate system,
cx ′ = (−ax sin θ + ay cos θ) bz − az (−bx sin θ + by cos θ)
= (ay bz − az by ) cos θ + (az bx − ax bz ) sin θ
= cx cos θ + cy sin θ.

(A.35)

Thus, the x-component of a × b transforms correctly. It can easily be shown that the other
components transform correctly as well, and that all components also transform correctly
under rotation about Ox and Oy. Thus, a × b is a proper vector. Incidentally, a × b is the
only simple combination of the components of two vectors that transforms like a vector
(which is non-coplanar with a and b). The cross product is anticommutative,
a × b = −b × a,

a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c,

(A.37)

a × (b × c) 6= (a × b) × c.

(A.38)

distributive,
but is not associative,
The cross product transforms like a vector, which means that it must have a welldefined direction and magnitude. We can show that a × b is perpendicular to both a and b.
Consider a · a × b. If this is zero then the cross product must be perpendicular to a. Now,
a · a × b = ax (ay bz − az by ) + ay (az bx − ax bz ) + az (ax by − ay bx )
= 0.

Figure A.7: The right-hand rule for cross products. Here, θ is less that 180◦ .
Therefore, a × b is perpendicular to a. Likewise, it can be demonstrated that a × b is
perpendicular to b. The vectors a, b, and a × b form a right-handed set, like the unit
vectors ex , ey , and ez . In fact, ex × ey = ez . This defines a unique direction for a × b, which
is obtained from a right-hand rule—see Figure A.7.
Let us now evaluate the magnitude of a × b. We have
(a × b)2 = (ay bz − az by )2 + (az bx − ax bz )2 + (ax by − ay bx )2

= (ax2 + ay2 + az2 ) (bx2 + by2 + bz2 ) − (ax bx + ay by + az bz )2

= |a|2 |b|2 − (a · b)2

= |a|2 |b|2 − |a|2 |b|2 cos2 θ = |a|2 |b|2 sin2 θ.

(A.40)

Thus,
|a × b| = |a| |b| sin θ,

(A.41)

where θ is the angle subtended between a and b. Clearly, a × a = 0 for any vector, since θ
is always zero in this case. Also, if a × b = 0 then either |a| = 0, |b| = 0, or b is parallel (or
antiparallel) to a.
Consider the parallelogram defined by the vectors a and b—see Figure A.8. The scalar
area of the parallelogram is a b sin θ. By convention, the vector area has the magnitude
of the scalar area, and is normal to the plane of the parallelogram, in the sense obtained
from a right-hand circulation rule by rotating a on to b (through an acute angle): i.e., if
the fingers of the right-hand circulate in the direction of rotation then the thumb of the
right-hand indicates the direction of the vector area. So, the vector area is coming out of
the page in Figure A.8. It follows that
S = a × b,

(A.42)

Suppose that a force F is applied at position r—see Figure A.9. The torque about
the origin O is the product of the magnitude of the force and the length of the lever
arm OQ. Thus, the magnitude of the torque is |F| |r| sin θ. The direction of the torque is
conventionally defined as the direction of the axis through O about which the force tries to

284

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

rotate objects, in the sense determined by a right-hand circulation rule. Hence, the torque
is out of the page in Figure A.9. It follows that the vector torque is given by
τ = r × F.

(A.43)

The angular momentum, l, of a particle of linear momentum p and position vector r is
simply defined as the moment of its momentum about the origin: i.e.,
l = r × p.

(A.44)

A.8 Rotation
Let us try to define a rotation vector θ whose magnitude is the angle of the rotation, θ, and
whose direction is parallel to the axis of rotation, in the sense determined by a right-hand
circulation rule. Unfortunately, this is not a good vector. The problem is that the addition
of rotations is not commutative, whereas vector addition is commuative. Figure A.10
shows the effect of applying two successive 90◦ rotations, one about Ox, and the other
about the Oz, to a standard six-sided die. In the left-hand case, the z-rotation is applied
before the x-rotation, and vice versa in the right-hand case. It can be seen that the die
ends up in two completely different states. In other words, the z-rotation plus the xrotation does not equal the x-rotation plus the z-rotation. This non-commuting algebra
cannot be represented by vectors. So, although rotations have a well-defined magnitude
and direction, they are not vector quantities.
But, this is not quite the end of the story. Suppose that we take a general vector a and
rotate it about Oz by a small angle δθz . This is equivalent to rotating the coordinate axes
about the Oz by −δθz . According to Equations (A.20)–(A.22), we have
a ′ ≃ a + δθz ez × a,

(A.45)

where use has been made of the small angle approximations sin θ ≃ θ and cos θ ≃ 1. The
above equation can easily be generalized to allow small rotations about Ox and Oy by δθx
and δθy , respectively. We find that
a ′ ≃ a + δθ × a,

where
δθ = δθx ex + δθy ey + δθz ez .

(A.47)

Clearly, we can define a rotation vector, δθ, but it only works for small angle rotations (i.e.,
sufficiently small that the small angle approximations of sine and cosine are good). According to the above equation, a small z-rotation plus a small x-rotation is (approximately)
equal to the two rotations applied in the opposite order. The fact that infinitesimal rotation
is a vector implies that angular velocity,
δθ
,
δt→0 δt

ω = lim

(A.48)

must be a vector as well. Also, if a ′ is interpreted as a(t + δt) in Equation (A.46) then it
follows that the equation of motion of a vector which precesses about the origin with some
angular velocity ω is
da
= ω × a.
(A.49)
dt

A.9 Scalar Triple Product
Consider three vectors a, b, and c. The scalar triple product is defined a · b × c. Now, b × c
is the vector area of the parallelogram defined by b and c. So, a · b × c is the scalar area
of this parallelogram multiplied by the component of a in the direction of its normal. It
follows that a · b × c is the volume of the parallelepiped defined by vectors a, b, and c—see
Figure A.11. This volume is independent of how the triple product is formed from a, b,
and c, except that
a · b × c = −a · c × b.
(A.50)
So, the “volume” is positive if a, b, and c form a right-handed set (i.e., if a lies above the
plane of b and c, in the sense determined from a right-hand circulation rule by rotating b
onto c) and negative if they form a left-handed set. The triple product is unchanged if the
dot and cross product operators are interchanged,
a · b × c = a × b · c.

(A.51)

The triple product is also invariant under any cyclic permutation of a, b, and c,
a · b × c = b · c × a = c · a × b,

(A.52)

but any anti-cyclic permutation causes it to change sign,
a · b × c = −b · a × c.

(A.53)

The scalar triple product is zero if any two of a, b, and c are parallel, or if a, b, and c are
coplanar.

If a, b, and c are non-coplanar then any vector r can be written in terms of them: i.e.,

Forming the dot product of this equation with b × c, we then obtain
r · b × c = α a · b × c,

(A.55)

A.10 Vector Triple Product
For three vectors a, b, and c, the vector triple product is defined a × (b × c). The brackets
are important because a × (b × c) 6= (a × b) × c. In fact, it can be demonstrated that
a × (b × c) ≡ (a · c) b − (a · b) c

(A.57)

(a × b) × c ≡ (a · c) b − (b · c) a.

(A.58)

and
Let us try to prove the first of the above theorems. The left-hand side and the right-hand
side are both proper vectors, so if we can prove this result in one particular coordinate
system then it must be true in general. Let us take convenient axes such that Ox lies
along b, and c lies in the x-y plane. It follows that b ≡ (bx , 0, 0), c ≡ (cx , cy , 0), and
a ≡ (ax , ay , az ). The vector b × c is directed along Oz: i.e., b × c ≡ (0, 0, bx cy ). Hence,
a × (b × c) lies in the x-y plane: i.e., a × (b × c) ≡ (ay bx cy , −ax bx cy , 0). This is the
left-hand side of Equation (A.57) in our convenient coordinate system. To evaluate the
right-hand side, we need a · c = ax cx + ay cy and a · b = ax bx . It follows that the righthand side is
RHS = ( [ax cx + ay cy ] bx , 0, 0) − (ax bx cx , ax bx cy , 0)
= (ay cy bx , −ax bx cy , 0) = LHS,

A.12 Line Integrals
Consider a two-dimensional function f(x, y) which is defined for all x and y. What is meant
by the integral of f along a given curve joining the points P and Q in the x-y plane? Well,
we first draw out f as a function of length l along the path—see Figure A.12. The integral
is then simply given by

ZQ
F(Q) = F(P) +
(f dx + g dy)

(A.74)

P

defines F(Q) for all other points in the plane. We can then draw a contour map of F(x, y).
The line integral between points P and Q is simply the change in height in the contour
map between these two points:

is independent of the path of integration.
It is clear that there are two distinct types of line integral. Those which depend only on
their endpoints and not on the path of integration, and those which depend both on their
endpoints and the integration path. Later on, we shall learn how to distinguish between
these two types (see Section A.15).

A.13 Vector Line Integrals
A vector field is defined as a set of vectors associated with each point in space. For instance,
the velocity v(r) in a moving liquid (e.g., a whirlpool) constitutes a vector field. By analogy,
a scalar field is a set of scalars associated with each point in space. An example of a scalar
field is the temperature distribution T (r) in a furnace.
Consider a general vector field A(r). Let dr ≡ (dx, dy, dz) be the vector element of
line length. Vector line integrals often arise as
ZQ
P

A · dr =

ZQ

(A.78)

(Ax dx + Ay dy + Az dz).

P

For instance, if A is a force-field then the line integral is the work done in going from P to
Q.
As an example, consider the work done by a repulsive inverse-square central field,
F = −r/|r3 |. The element of work done is dW = F·dr. Take P = (∞, 0, 0) and Q = (a, 0, 0).

The second route is, firstly, around a large circle (r = constant) to the point (a, ∞, 0), and
then parallel to the y-axis—see Figure A.15. In the first part, no work is done, since F is
perpendicular to dr. In the second part,

As an example of a volume integral, let us evaluate the center of gravity of a solid pyramid. Suppose that the pyramid has a square base of side a, a height a, and is composed of
material of uniform density. Let the centroid of the base lie at the origin, and let the apex
lie at (0, 0, a). By symmetry, the center of mass lies on the line joining the centroid to the

A.15 Gradient
A one-dimensional function f(x) has a gradient df/dx which is defined as the slope of the
tangent to the curve at x. We wish to extend this idea to cover scalar fields in two and
three dimensions.
Consider a two-dimensional scalar field h(x, y), which is (say) height above sea-level
in a hilly region. Let dr ≡ (dx, dy) be an element of horizontal distance. Consider dh/dr,
where dh is the change in height after moving an infinitesimal distance dr. This quantity
is somewhat like the one-dimensional gradient, except that dh depends on the direction of
dr, as well as its magnitude. In the immediate vicinity of some point P, the slope reduces
to an inclined plane—see Figure A.16. The largest value of dh/dr is straight up the slope.
It is easily shown that for any other direction
dh
=
dr

cos θ,

(A.86)

max

where θ is the angle shown in Figure A.16. Let us define a two-dimensional vector, grad h,
called the gradient of h, whose magnitude is (dh/dr)max , and whose direction is the direction of steepest ascent. The cos θ variation exhibited in the above expression ensures that
the component of grad h in any direction is equal to dh/dr for that direction.
The component of dh/dr in the x-direction can be obtained by plotting out the profile
of h at constant y, and then finding the slope of the tangent to the curve at given x. This

294

NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS

quantity is known as the partial derivative of h with respect to x at constant y, and is
denoted (∂h/∂x)y . Likewise, the gradient of the profile at constant x is written (∂h/∂y)x .
Note that the subscripts denoting constant-x and constant-y are usually omitted, unless
there is any ambiguity. If follows that in component form
grad h ≡

!

∂h ∂h

,
∂x ∂y

(A.87)

Now, the equation of the tangent plane at P = (x0 , y0 ) is
hT (x, y) = h(x0 , y0 ) + α (x − x0 ) + β (y − y0 ).

(A.88)

This has the same local gradients as h(x, y), so
α=

∂h

∂x

β=

by differentiation of the above. For small dx = x − x0 and dy = y − y0 , the function h is
coincident with the tangent plane, so
dh =

∂h
∂h
dx +
dy.
∂x
∂y

(A.90)

But, grad h ≡ (∂h/∂x, ∂h/∂y) and dr ≡ (dx, dy), so
dh = grad h · dr.

(A.91)

Incidentally, the above equation demonstrates that grad h is a proper vector, since the lefthand side is a scalar, and, according to the properties of the dot product, the right-hand
side is also a scalar provided that dr and grad h are both proper vectors (dr is an obvious
vector, because it is directly derived from displacements).
Consider, now, a three-dimensional temperature distribution T (x, y, z) in (say) a reaction vessel. Let us define grad T , as before, as a vector whose magnitude is (dT/dr)max ,
and whose direction is the direction of the maximum gradient. This vector is written in

Suppose that dT = 0 for some dr. It follows that
dT = grad T · dr = 0.

So, dr is perpendicular to grad T . Since dT = 0 along so-called “isotherms” (i.e., contours
of the temperature), we conclude that the isotherms (contours) are everywhere perpendicular to grad T —see Figure A.17.
It is, of course, possible to integrate dT . For instance, the line integral of dT between
points P and Q is written

RQ
This integral is clearly independent of the path taken between P and Q, so P grad T · dr
must be path independent.
RQ
Consider a vector field A(r). In general, the line integral P A · dr depends on the
path taken between the end points, but for some special vector fields the integral is path
independent. Such fields are called conservative fields. It can be shown that if A is a conservative field then A = grad V for some scalar field V. The proof of this is straightforward.
Keeping P fixed, we have
ZQ
A · dr = V(Q),
(A.97)
P

where V(Q) is a well-defined function, due to the path independent nature of the line
integral. Consider moving the position of the end point by an infinitesimal amount dx in
the x-direction. We have

V(Q + dx) = V(Q) +

is done in going around a closed loop is equivalent to the conservation of energy (which is
why conservative fields are called “conservative”). A good example of a non-conservative
field is the forceHdue to friction. Clearly, a frictional system loses energy in going around a
closed cycle, so A · dr 6= 0.

For two scalar fields φ and ψ,

can be written more succinctly as
∇(φ ψ) = φ ∇ψ + ψ ∇φ.

(A.105)

Suppose that we rotate the coordinate axes through an angle θ about Oz. By analogy
with Equations (A.17)–(A.19), the old coordinates (x, y, z) are related to the new ones
(x ′ , y ′ , z ′ ) via
x = x ′ cos θ − y ′ sin θ,

y = x ′ sin θ + y ′ cos θ,

It can be seen, from Equations (A.20)–(A.22), that the differential operator ∇ transforms
in an analogous manner to a vector. This is another proof that ∇f is a good vector.

A.17 Curvilinear Coordinates
In the
q cylindrical coordinate system, the Cartesian coordinates x and y are replaced by
r = x2 + y2 and θ = tan−1 (y/x). Here, r is the perpendicular distance from the z-axis,
and θ the angle subtended between the perpendicular radius vector and the x-axis—see
Figure A.18. A general vector A is thus written
A = Ar er + Aθ eθ + Az ez ,

(A.112)

where er = ∇r/|∇r| and eθ = ∇θ/|∇θ|—see Figure A.18. Note that the unit vectors er ,
eθ , and ez are mutually orthogonal. Hence, Ar = A · er , etc. The volume element in this
coordinate system is d3 r = r dr dθ dz. Moreover, the gradient of a general scalar field V(r)

Figure A.19: Spherical polar coordinates.
In the
q spherical coordinate system, the Cartesian coordinates x, y, and z are replaced
by r = x2 + y2 + z2 , θ = cos−1 (z/r), and φ = tan−1 (y/x). Here, r is the radial distance
from the origin, θ the angle subtended between the radius vector and the z-axis, and φ
the angle subtended between the projection of the radius vector onto the x-y plane and
the x-axis—see Figure A.19. Note that r and θ in the spherical system are not the same as
their counterparts in the cylindrical system. A general vector A is written
A = Ar er + Aθ eθ + Aφ eφ ,

(A.114)

where er = ∇r/|∇r|, eθ = ∇θ/|∇θ|, and eφ = ∇φ/|∇φ|. The unit vectors er , eθ , and eφ
are mutually orthogonal. Hence, Ar = A · er , etc. The volume element in this coordinate
system is d3 r = r2 sin θ dr dθ dφ. Moreover, the gradient of a general scalar field V(r)
